Install OpenClaw, run onboarding, and chat with your AI assistant — all in
about 5 minutes. By the end you will have a running Gateway, configured auth,
and a working chat session.

## What you need

- **Node.js** — Node 24 recommended (Node 22.16+ also supported)
- **An API key** from a model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) — onboarding will prompt you

> **Note:** Check your Node version with `node --version`.
**Windows users:** both native Windows and WSL2 are supported. WSL2 is more
stable and recommended for the full experience. See [Windows](/platforms/windows).
Need to install Node? See [Node setup](/install/node).


## Quick setup

**Install OpenClaw**

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
        curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
        ```
        <img
  src="/assets/install-script.svg"
  alt="Install Script Process"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
      
**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
        iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
        ```
      
> **Note:** Other install methods (Docker, Nix, npm): [Install](/install).
    

  
**Run onboarding**

```bash
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    ```

    The wizard walks you through choosing a model provider, setting an API key,
    and configuring the Gateway. It takes about 2 minutes.

    See [Onboarding (CLI)](/start/wizard) for the full reference.

  
**Verify the Gateway is running**

```bash
    openclaw gateway status
    ```

    You should see the Gateway listening on port 18789.

  
**Open the dashboard**

```bash
    openclaw dashboard
    ```

    This opens the Control UI in your browser. If it loads, everything is working.

  
**Send your first message**

Type a message in the Control UI chat and you should get an AI reply.

    Want to chat from your phone instead? The fastest channel to set up is
    [Telegram](/channels/telegram) (just a bot token). See [Channels](/channels)
    for all options.

  
### Advanced: mount a custom Control UI build

If you maintain a localized or customized dashboard build, point
  `gateway.controlUi.root` to a directory that contains your built static
  assets and `index.html`.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.openclaw/control-ui-custom"
# Copy your built static files into that directory.
```

Then set:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "controlUi": {
      "enabled": true,
      "root": "$HOME/.openclaw/control-ui-custom"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway and reopen the dashboard:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw dashboard
```

## What to do next


  **Connect a channel:** Discord, Feishu, iMessage, Matrix, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Zalo, and more.
  

**Pairing and safety:** Control who can message your agent.
  

**Configure the Gateway:** Models, tools, sandbox, and advanced settings.
  

**Browse tools:** Browser, exec, web search, skills, and plugins.
  



### Advanced: environment variables

If you run OpenClaw as a service account or want custom paths:

- `OPENCLAW_HOME` — home directory for internal path resolution
- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` — override the state directory
- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` — override the config file path
