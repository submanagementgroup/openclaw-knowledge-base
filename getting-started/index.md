  <strong>Any OS gateway for AI agents across Discord, Google Chat, iMessage, Matrix, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Zalo, and more.</strong><br />
  Send a message, get an agent response from your pocket. Run one Gateway across built-in channels, bundled channel plugins, WebChat, and mobile nodes.
</p>


  **Get Started:** Install OpenClaw and bring up the Gateway in minutes.
  

**Run Onboarding:** Guided setup with `openclaw onboard` and pairing flows.
  

**Open the Control UI:** Launch the browser dashboard for chat, config, and sessions.
  



## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a **self-hosted gateway** that connects your favorite chat apps and channel surfaces — built-in channels plus bundled or external channel plugins such as Discord, Google Chat, iMessage, Matrix, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Zalo, and more — to AI coding agents like Pi. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine (or a server), and it becomes the bridge between your messaging apps and an always-available AI assistant.

**Who is it for?** Developers and power users who want a personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.

**What makes it different?**

- **Self-hosted**: runs on your hardware, your rules
- **Multi-channel**: one Gateway serves built-in channels plus bundled or external channel plugins simultaneously
- **Agent-native**: built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, and multi-agent routing
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

**What do you need?** Node 24 (recommended), or Node 22 LTS (`22.16+`) for compatibility, an API key from your chosen provider, and 5 minutes. For best quality and security, use the strongest latest-generation model available.

## How it works

```

The Gateway is the single source of truth for sessions, routing, and channel connections.

## Key capabilities


  **Multi-channel gateway:** Discord, iMessage, Signal, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, WebChat, and more with a single Gateway process.
  

**Plugin channels:** Bundled plugins add Matrix, Nostr, Twitch, Zalo, and more in normal current releases.
  

**Multi-agent routing:** Isolated sessions per agent, workspace, or sender.
  

**Media support:** Send and receive images, audio, and documents.
  

**Web Control UI:** Browser dashboard for chat, config, sessions, and nodes.
  

**Mobile nodes:** Pair iOS and Android nodes for Canvas, camera, and voice-enabled workflows.
  



## Quick start

**Install OpenClaw**

```bash
    npm install -g openclaw@latest
    ```
  
**Onboard and install the service**

```bash
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    ```
  
**Chat**

Open the Control UI in your browser and send a message:

    ```bash
    openclaw dashboard
    ```

    Or connect a channel ([Telegram](/channels/telegram) is fastest) and chat from your phone.

  
Need the full install and dev setup? See [Getting Started](/start/getting-started).

## Dashboard

Open the browser Control UI after the Gateway starts.

- Local default: [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/)
- Remote access: [Web surfaces](/web) and [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale)

## Configuration (optional)

Config lives at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

- If you **do nothing**, OpenClaw uses the bundled Pi binary in RPC mode with per-sender sessions.
- If you want to lock it down, start with `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` and (for groups) mention rules.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
  messages: { groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw"] } },
}
```
