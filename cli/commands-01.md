## openclaw agent Command

# `openclaw agent`

Run an agent turn via the Gateway (use `--local` for embedded).
Use `--agent <id>` to target a configured agent directly.

Pass at least one session selector:

- `--to <dest>`
- `--session-id <id>`
- `--agent <id>`

- Agent send tool: [Agent send](/tools/agent-send)

## Options

- `-m, --message <text>`: required message body
- `-t, --to <dest>`: recipient used to derive the session key
- `--session-id <id>`: explicit session id
- `--agent <id>`: agent id; overrides routing bindings
- `--model <id>`: model override for this run (`provider/model` or model id)
- `--thinking <level>`: agent thinking level (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, plus provider-supported custom levels such as `xhigh`, `adaptive`, or `max`)
- `--verbose <on|off>`: persist verbose level for the session
- `--channel <channel>`: delivery channel; omit to use the main session channel
- `--reply-to <target>`: delivery target override
- `--reply-channel <channel>`: delivery channel override
- `--reply-account <id>`: delivery account override
- `--local`: run the embedded agent directly (after plugin registry preload)
- `--deliver`: send the reply back to the selected channel/target
- `--timeout <seconds>`: override agent timeout (default 600 or config value)
- `--json`: output JSON

## Examples

```bash
openclaw agent --to +15555550123 --message "status update" --deliver
openclaw agent --agent ops --message "Summarize logs"
openclaw agent --agent ops --model openai/gpt-5.4 --message "Summarize logs"
openclaw agent --session-id 1234 --message "Summarize inbox" --thinking medium
openclaw agent --to +15555550123 --message "Trace logs" --verbose on --json
openclaw agent --agent ops --message "Generate report" --deliver --reply-channel slack --reply-to "#reports"
openclaw agent --agent ops --message "Run locally" --local
```

## Notes

- Gateway mode falls back to the embedded agent when the Gateway request fails. Use `--local` to force embedded execution up front.
- `--local` still preloads the plugin registry first, so plugin-provided providers, tools, and channels stay available during embedded runs.
- `--local` and embedded fallback runs are treated as one-shot runs. Bundled MCP loopback resources and warm Claude stdio sessions opened for that local process are retired after the reply, so scripted invocations do not keep local child processes alive.
- Gateway-backed runs leave Gateway-owned MCP loopback resources under the running Gateway process; older clients may still send the historical cleanup flag, but the Gateway accepts it as a compatibility no-op.
- `--channel`, `--reply-channel`, and `--reply-account` affect reply delivery, not session routing.
- `--json` keeps stdout reserved for the JSON response. Gateway, plugin, and embedded-fallback diagnostics are routed to stderr so scripts can parse stdout directly.
- Embedded fallback JSON includes `meta.transport: "embedded"` and `meta.fallbackFrom: "gateway"` so scripts can distinguish fallback runs from Gateway runs.
- If the Gateway accepts an agent run but the CLI times out waiting for the final reply, embedded fallback uses a fresh explicit `gateway-fallback-*` session/run id and reports `meta.fallbackReason: "gateway_timeout"` plus the fallback session fields. This avoids racing the Gateway-owned transcript lock or silently replacing the original routed conversation session.
- When this command triggers `models.json` regeneration, SecretRef-managed provider credentials are persisted as non-secret markers (for example env var names, `secretref-env:ENV_VAR_NAME`, or `secretref-managed`), not resolved secret plaintext.
- Marker writes are source-authoritative: OpenClaw persists markers from the active source config snapshot, not from resolved runtime secret values.

## JSON delivery status

When `--json --deliver` is used, the CLI JSON response may include top-level `deliveryStatus` so scripts can distinguish delivered, suppressed, partial, and failed sends:

```json
{
  "payloads": [{ "text": "Report ready", "mediaUrl": null }],
  "meta": { "durationMs": 1200 },
  "deliveryStatus": {
    "requested": true,
    "attempted": true,
    "status": "sent",
    "succeeded": true,
    "resultCount": 1
  }
}
```

`deliveryStatus.status` is one of `sent`, `suppressed`, `partial_failed`, or `failed`. `suppressed` means delivery was intentionally not sent, for example a message-sending hook cancelled it or there was no visible result; it is still a terminal no-retry outcome. `partial_failed` means at least one payload was sent before a later payload failed. `failed` means no durable send completed or delivery preflight failed.

Gateway-backed CLI responses also preserve the raw Gateway result shape, where the same object is available at `result.deliveryStatus`.

Common fields:

- `requested`: always `true` when the object is present.
- `attempted`: `true` after the durable send path ran; `false` for preflight failures or no visible payloads.
- `succeeded`: `true`, `false`, or `"partial"`; `"partial"` pairs with `status: "partial_failed"`.
- `reason`: a lowercase snake-case reason from durable delivery or preflight validation. Known reasons include `cancelled_by_message_sending_hook`, `no_visible_payload`, `no_visible_result`, `channel_resolved_to_internal`, `unknown_channel`, `invalid_delivery_target`, and `no_delivery_target`; failed durable sends may also report the failed stage. Treat unknown values as opaque because the set can expand.
- `resultCount`: number of channel send results when available.
- `sentBeforeError`: `true` when a partial failure sent at least one payload before the error.
- `error`: boolean `true` for failed or partial-failed sends.
- `errorMessage`: included only when an underlying delivery error message is captured. Preflight failures carry `error` and `reason` but no `errorMessage`.
- `payloadOutcomes`: optional per-payload results with `index`, `status`, `reason`, `resultCount`, `error`, `stage`, `sentBeforeError`, or hook metadata when available.

## openclaw agents Command

# `openclaw agents`

Manage isolated agents (workspaces + auth + routing).

Related:

- [Multi-agent routing](/concepts/multi-agent)
- [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace)
- [Skills config](/tools/skills-config): skill visibility configuration.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw agents list
openclaw agents list --bindings
openclaw agents add work --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace-work
openclaw agents add ops --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace-ops --bind telegram:ops --non-interactive
openclaw agents bindings
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents set-identity --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --from-identity
openclaw agents set-identity --agent main --avatar avatars/openclaw.png
openclaw agents delete work
```

## Routing bindings

Use routing bindings to pin inbound channel traffic to a specific agent.

If you also want different visible skills per agent, configure `agents.defaults.skills` and `agents.list[].skills` in `openclaw.json`. See [Skills config](/tools/skills-config) and [Configuration reference](/gateway/config-agents#agents-defaults-skills).

List bindings:

```bash
openclaw agents bindings
openclaw agents bindings --agent work
openclaw agents bindings --json
```

Add bindings:

```bash
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops --bind discord:guild-a
```

If you omit `accountId` (`--bind <channel>`), OpenClaw resolves it from channel defaults and plugin setup hooks when available.

If you omit `--agent` for `bind` or `unbind`, OpenClaw targets the current default agent.

### Binding scope behavior

- A binding without `accountId` matches the channel default account only.
- `accountId: "*"` is the channel-wide fallback (all accounts) and is less specific than an explicit account binding.
- If the same agent already has a matching channel binding without `accountId`, and you later bind with an explicit or resolved `accountId`, OpenClaw upgrades that existing binding in place instead of adding a duplicate.

Example:

```bash
# initial channel-only binding
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram

# later upgrade to account-scoped binding
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
```

After the upgrade, routing for that binding is scoped to `telegram:ops`. If you also want default-account routing, add it explicitly (for example `--bind telegram:default`).

Remove bindings:

```bash
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --all
```

`unbind` accepts either `--all` or one or more `--bind` values, not both.

## Command surface

### `agents`

Running `openclaw agents` with no subcommand is equivalent to `openclaw agents list`.

### `agents list`

Options:

- `--json`
- `--bindings`: include full routing rules, not only per-agent counts/summaries

### `agents add [name]`

Options:

- `--workspace <dir>`
- `--model <id>`
- `--agent-dir <dir>`
- `--bind <channel[:accountId]>` (repeatable)
- `--non-interactive`
- `--json`

Notes:

- Passing any explicit add flags switches the command into the non-interactive path.
- Non-interactive mode requires both an agent name and `--workspace`.
- `main` is reserved and cannot be used as the new agent id.
- In interactive mode, auth seeding copies only portable static profiles
  (`api_key` and static `token` by default). OAuth refresh-token profiles remain
  available only by read-through inheritance from the real `main` agent store.
  If the configured default agent is not `main`, sign in separately for OAuth
  profiles on the new agent.

### `agents bindings`

Options:

- `--agent <id>`
- `--json`

### `agents bind`

Options:

- `--agent <id>` (defaults to the current default agent)
- `--bind <channel[:accountId]>` (repeatable)
- `--json`

### `agents unbind`

Options:

- `--agent <id>` (defaults to the current default agent)
- `--bind <channel[:accountId]>` (repeatable)
- `--all`
- `--json`

### `agents delete <id>`

Options:

- `--force`
- `--json`

Notes:

- `main` cannot be deleted.
- Without `--force`, interactive confirmation is required.
- Workspace, agent state, and session transcript directories are moved to Trash, not hard-deleted.
- When the Gateway is reachable, deletion is sent through the Gateway so config and session-store cleanup share the same writer as runtime traffic. If the Gateway cannot be reached, the CLI falls back to the offline local path.
- If another agent's workspace is the same path, inside this workspace, or contains this workspace,
  the workspace is retained and `--json` reports `workspaceRetained`,
  `workspaceRetainedReason`, and `workspaceSharedWith`.

## Identity files

Each agent workspace can include an `IDENTITY.md` at the workspace root:

- Example path: `~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md`
- `set-identity --from-identity` reads from the workspace root (or an explicit `--identity-file`)

Avatar paths resolve relative to the workspace root.

## Set identity

`set-identity` writes fields into `agents.list[].identity`:

- `name`
- `theme`
- `emoji`
- `avatar` (workspace-relative path, http(s) URL, or data URI)

Options:

- `--agent <id>`
- `--workspace <dir>`
- `--identity-file <path>`
- `--from-identity`
- `--name <name>`
- `--theme <theme>`
- `--emoji <emoji>`
- `--avatar <value>`
- `--json`

Notes:

- `--agent` or `--workspace` can be used to select the target agent.
- If you rely on `--workspace` and multiple agents share that workspace, the command fails and asks you to pass `--agent`.
- When no explicit identity fields are provided, the command reads identity data from `IDENTITY.md`.

Load from `IDENTITY.md`:

```bash
openclaw agents set-identity --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --from-identity
```

Override fields explicitly:

```bash
openclaw agents set-identity --agent main --name "OpenClaw" --emoji "🦞" --avatar avatars/openclaw.png
```

Config sample:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "main",
        identity: {
          name: "OpenClaw",
          theme: "space lobster",
          emoji: "🦞",
          avatar: "avatars/openclaw.png",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

## openclaw approvals Command

# `openclaw approvals`

Manage exec approvals for the **local host**, **gateway host**, or a **node host**.
By default, commands target the local approvals file on disk. Use `--gateway` to target the gateway, or `--node` to target a specific node.

Alias: `openclaw exec-approvals`

Related:

- Exec approvals: [Exec approvals](/tools/exec-approvals)
- Nodes: [Nodes](/nodes)

## `openclaw exec-policy`

`openclaw exec-policy` is the local convenience command for keeping the requested
`tools.exec.*` config and the local host approvals file aligned in one step.

Use it when you want to:

- inspect the local requested policy, host approvals file, and effective merge
- apply a local preset such as YOLO or deny-all
- synchronize local `tools.exec.*` and local `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`

Examples:

```bash
openclaw exec-policy show
openclaw exec-policy show --json

openclaw exec-policy preset yolo
openclaw exec-policy preset cautious --json

openclaw exec-policy set --host gateway --security full --ask off --ask-fallback full
```

Output modes:

- no `--json`: prints the human-readable table view
- `--json`: prints machine-readable structured output

Current scope:

- `exec-policy` is **local-only**
- it updates the local config file and the local approvals file together
- it does **not** push policy to the gateway host or a node host
- `--host node` is rejected in this command because node exec approvals are fetched from the node at runtime and must be managed through node-targeted approvals commands instead
- `openclaw exec-policy show` marks `host=node` scopes as node-managed at runtime instead of deriving an effective policy from the local approvals file

If you need to edit remote host approvals directly, keep using `openclaw approvals set --gateway`
or `openclaw approvals set --node <id|name|ip>`.

## Common commands

```bash
openclaw approvals get
openclaw approvals get --node <id|name|ip>
openclaw approvals get --gateway
```

`openclaw approvals get` now shows the effective exec policy for local, gateway, and node targets:

- requested `tools.exec` policy
- host approvals-file policy
- effective result after precedence rules are applied

Precedence is intentional:

- the host approvals file is the enforceable source of truth
- requested `tools.exec` policy can narrow or broaden intent, but the effective result is still derived from the host rules
- `--node` combines the node host approvals file with gateway `tools.exec` policy, because both still apply at runtime
- if gateway config is unavailable, the CLI falls back to the node approvals snapshot and notes that the final runtime policy could not be computed

## Replace approvals from a file

```bash
openclaw approvals set --file ./exec-approvals.json
openclaw approvals set --stdin <<'EOF'
{ version: 1, defaults: { security: "full", ask: "off" } }
EOF
openclaw approvals set --node <id|name|ip> --file ./exec-approvals.json
openclaw approvals set --gateway --file ./exec-approvals.json
```

`set` accepts JSON5, not only strict JSON. Use either `--file` or `--stdin`, not both.

## "Never prompt" / YOLO example

For a host that should never stop on exec approvals, set the host approvals defaults to `full` + `off`:

```bash
openclaw approvals set --stdin <<'EOF'
{
  version: 1,
  defaults: {
    security: "full",
    ask: "off",
    askFallback: "full"
  }
}
EOF
```

Node variant:

```bash
openclaw approvals set --node <id|name|ip> --stdin <<'EOF'
{
  version: 1,
  defaults: {
    security: "full",
    ask: "off",
    askFallback: "full"
  }
}
EOF
```

This changes the **host approvals file** only. To keep the requested OpenClaw policy aligned, also set:

```bash
openclaw config set tools.exec.host gateway
openclaw config set tools.exec.security full
openclaw config set tools.exec.ask off
```

Why `tools.exec.host=gateway` in this example:

- `host=auto` still means "sandbox when available, otherwise gateway".
- YOLO is about approvals, not routing.
- If you want host exec even when a sandbox is configured, make the host choice explicit with `gateway` or `/exec host=gateway`.

This matches the current host-default YOLO behavior. Tighten it if you want approvals.

Local shortcut:

```bash
openclaw exec-policy preset yolo
```

That local shortcut updates both the requested local `tools.exec.*` config and the
local approvals defaults together. It is equivalent in intent to the manual two-step
setup above, but only for the local machine.

## Allowlist helpers

```bash
openclaw approvals allowlist add "~/Projects/**/bin/rg"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main --node <id|name|ip> "/usr/bin/uptime"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent "*" "/usr/bin/uname"

openclaw approvals allowlist remove "~/Projects/**/bin/rg"
```

## Common options

`get`, `set`, and `allowlist add|remove` all support:

- `--node <id|name|ip>`
- `--gateway`
- shared node RPC options: `--url`, `--token`, `--timeout`, `--json`

Targeting notes:

- no target flags means the local approvals file on disk
- `--gateway` targets the gateway host approvals file
- `--node` targets one node host after resolving id, name, IP, or id prefix

`allowlist add|remove` also supports:

- `--agent <id>` (defaults to `*`)

## Notes

- `--node` uses the same resolver as `openclaw nodes` (id, name, ip, or id prefix).
- `--agent` defaults to `"*"`, which applies to all agents.
- The node host must advertise `system.execApprovals.get/set` (macOS app or headless node host).
- Approvals files are stored per host at `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`.

## openclaw backup Command

# `openclaw backup`

Create a local backup archive for OpenClaw state, config, auth profiles, channel/provider credentials, sessions, and optionally workspaces.

```bash
openclaw backup create
openclaw backup create --output ~/Backups
openclaw backup create --dry-run --json
openclaw backup create --verify
openclaw backup create --no-include-workspace
openclaw backup create --only-config
openclaw backup verify ./2026-03-09T00-00-00.000Z-openclaw-backup.tar.gz
```

## Notes

- The archive includes a `manifest.json` file with the resolved source paths and archive layout.
- Default output is a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive in the current working directory.
- If the current working directory is inside a backed-up source tree, OpenClaw falls back to your home directory for the default archive location.
- Existing archive files are never overwritten.
- Output paths inside the source state/workspace trees are rejected to avoid self-inclusion.
- `openclaw backup verify <archive>` validates that the archive contains exactly one root manifest, rejects traversal-style archive paths, and checks that every manifest-declared payload exists in the tarball.
- `openclaw backup create --verify` runs that validation immediately after writing the archive.
- `openclaw backup create --only-config` backs up just the active JSON config file.

## What gets backed up

`openclaw backup create` plans backup sources from your local OpenClaw install:

- The state directory returned by OpenClaw's local state resolver, usually `~/.openclaw`
- The active config file path
- The resolved `credentials/` directory when it exists outside the state directory
- Workspace directories discovered from the current config, unless you pass `--no-include-workspace`

Model auth profiles are already part of the state directory under
`agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`, so they are normally covered by the
state backup entry.

If you use `--only-config`, OpenClaw skips state, credentials-directory, and workspace discovery and archives only the active config file path.

OpenClaw canonicalizes paths before building the archive. If config, the
credentials directory, or a workspace already live inside the state directory,
they are not duplicated as separate top-level backup sources. Missing paths are
skipped.

The archive payload stores file contents from those source trees, and the embedded `manifest.json` records the resolved absolute source paths plus the archive layout used for each asset.

During archive creation, OpenClaw skips known live-mutation files that do not have restoration value, including active agent session transcripts, cron run logs, rolling logs, delivery queues, socket/pid/temp files under the state directory, and related durable-queue temp files. The JSON result includes `skippedVolatileCount` so automation can see how many files were intentionally omitted.

Installed plugin source and manifest files under the state directory's
`extensions/` tree are included, but their nested `node_modules/` dependency
trees are skipped. Those dependencies are rebuildable install artifacts; after
restoring an archive, use `openclaw plugins update <id>` or reinstall the plugin
with `openclaw plugins install <spec> --force` when a restored plugin reports
missing dependencies.

## Invalid config behavior

`openclaw backup` intentionally bypasses the normal config preflight so it can still help during recovery. Because workspace discovery depends on a valid config, `openclaw backup create` now fails fast when the config file exists but is invalid and workspace backup is still enabled.

If you still want a partial backup in that situation, rerun:

```bash
openclaw backup create --no-include-workspace
```

That keeps state, config, and the external credentials directory in scope while
skipping workspace discovery entirely.

If you only need a copy of the config file itself, `--only-config` also works when the config is malformed because it does not rely on parsing the config for workspace discovery.
