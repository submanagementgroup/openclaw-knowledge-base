CLI utility commands: ACP, status, logs, update, backup, and migrate.

## ACP CLI (openclaw acp)

Run the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) bridge that talks to an OpenClaw Gateway.

This command speaks ACP over stdio for IDEs and forwards prompts to the Gateway
over WebSocket. It keeps ACP sessions mapped to Gateway session keys.

`openclaw acp` is a Gateway-backed ACP bridge, not a full ACP-native editor
runtime. It focuses on session routing, prompt delivery, and basic streaming
updates.

If you want an external MCP client to talk directly to OpenClaw channel
conversations instead of hosting an ACP harness session, use
[`openclaw mcp serve`](/cli/mcp) instead.

## What this is not

This page is often confused with ACP harness sessions.

`openclaw acp` means:

- OpenClaw acts as an ACP server
- an IDE or ACP client connects to OpenClaw
- OpenClaw forwards that work into a Gateway session

This is different from [ACP Agents](/tools/acp-agents), where OpenClaw runs an
external harness such as Codex or Claude Code through `acpx`.

Quick rule:

- editor/client wants to talk ACP to OpenClaw: use `openclaw acp`
- OpenClaw should launch Codex/Claude/Gemini as an ACP harness: use `/acp spawn` and [ACP Agents](/tools/acp-agents)

## Status CLI (openclaw status)

# `openclaw status`

Diagnostics for channels + sessions.

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw status --all
openclaw status --deep
openclaw status --usage
```

Notes:

- `--deep` runs live probes (WhatsApp Web + Telegram + Discord + Slack + Signal).
- Plain `openclaw status` stays on the fast read-only path and marks memory as `not checked` instead of unavailable when it skips memory inspection. Heavy security audit, plugin compatibility, and memory-vector probes are left to `openclaw status --all`, `openclaw status --deep`, `openclaw security audit`, and `openclaw memory status --deep`.
- `status --json --all` reports memory details from the active memory plugin runtime selected by `plugins.slots.memory`. Custom memory plugins can leave built-in `agents.defaults.memorySearch.enabled` disabled and still report their own files, chunks, vector, and FTS state.
- `--usage` prints normalized provider usage windows as `X% left`.
- Session status output separates `Execution:` from `Runtime:`. `Execution` is the sandbox path (`direct`, `docker/*`), while `Runtime` tells you whether the session is using `OpenClaw Pi Default`, `OpenAI Codex`, a CLI backend, or an ACP backend such as `codex (acp/acpx)`. See [Agent runtimes](/concepts/agent-runtimes) for the provider/model/runtime distinction.
- MiniMax's raw `usage_percent` / `usagePercent` fields are remaining quota, so OpenClaw inverts them before display; count-based fields win when present. `model_remains` responses prefer the chat-model entry, derive the window label from timestamps when needed, and include the model name in the plan label.
- When the current session snapshot is sparse, `/status` can backfill token and cache counters from the most recent transcript usage log. Existing nonzero live values still win over transcript fallback values.
- Transcript fallback can also recover the active runtime model label when the live session entry is missing it. If that transcript model differs from the selected model, status res

## Logs CLI (openclaw logs)

# `openclaw logs`

Tail Gateway file logs over RPC (works in remote mode).

Related:

- Logging overview: [Logging](/logging)
- Gateway CLI: [gateway](/cli/gateway)

## Options

- `--limit <n>`: maximum number of log lines to return (default `200`)
- `--max-bytes <n>`: maximum bytes to read from the log file (default `250000`)
- `--follow`: follow the log stream
- `--interval <ms>`: polling interval while following (default `1000`)
- `--json`: emit line-delimited JSON events
- `--plain`: plain text output without styled formatting
- `--no-color`: disable ANSI colors
- `--local-time`: render timestamps in your local timezone

## Shared Gateway RPC options

`openclaw logs` also accepts the standard Gateway client flags:

- `--url <url>`: Gateway WebSocket URL
- `--token <token>`: Gateway token
- `--timeout <ms>`: timeout in ms (default `30000`)
- `--expect-final`: wait for a final response when the Gateway call is agent-backed

When you pass `--url`, the CLI does not auto-apply config or environment credentials. Include `--token` explicitly if the target Gateway requires auth.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw logs
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw logs --follow --interval 2000
openclaw logs --limit 500 --max-bytes 500000
openclaw logs --json
openclaw logs --plain
openclaw logs --no-color
openclaw logs --limit 500
openclaw logs --local-time
openclaw logs --follow --local-time
openclaw logs --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --token "$OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

## Notes

- Use `--local-time` to render timestamps in your local timezone.
- If the implicit local loopback Gateway asks for pairing, closes during connect, or times out before `logs.tail` answers, `openclaw logs` falls back to the configured Gateway file log automatically. Explicit `--url` targets do not use this fallback.

## Update CLI (openclaw update)

# `openclaw update`

Safely update OpenClaw and switch between stable/beta/dev channels.

If you installed via **npm/pnpm/bun** (global install, no git metadata),
updates happen via the package-manager flow in [Updating](/install/updating).

## Usage

```bash
openclaw update
openclaw update status
openclaw update wizard
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel dev
openclaw update --tag beta
openclaw update --tag main
openclaw update --dry-run
openclaw update --no-restart
openclaw update --yes
openclaw update --json
openclaw --update
```

## Options

- `--no-restart`: skip restarting the Gateway service after a successful update. Package-manager updates that do restart the Gateway verify the restarted service reports the expected updated version before the command succeeds.
- `--channel <stable|beta|dev>`: set the update channel (git + npm; persisted in config).
- `--tag <dist-tag|version|spec>`: override the package target for this update only. For package installs, `main` maps to `github:openclaw/openclaw#main`.
- `--dry-run`: preview planned update actions (channel/tag/target/restart flow) without writing config, installing, syncing plugins, or restarting.
- `--json`: print machine-readable `UpdateRunResult` JSON, including
  `postUpdate.plugins.integrityDrifts` when npm plugin artifact drift is
  detected during post-update plugin sync.
- `--timeout <seconds>`: per-step timeout (default is 1800s).
- `--yes`: skip confirmation prompts (for example downgrade confirmation).

Downgrades require confirmation because older versions can break configuration.

## `update status`

Show the active update channel + git tag/branch/SHA (for source checkouts), plus update availability.

```bash
openclaw update status
openclaw update status --json
openclaw update status --timeout 10
```

Options:

- `--json`: print machine-readable status JSON.
- `--timeout <seconds>`: timeout for checks (default is 3s).

## `update wizard`

Interactive flow to pick an update cha

## Backup CLI (openclaw backup)

# `openclaw backup`

Create a local backup archive for OpenClaw state, config, auth profiles, channel/provider credentials, sessions, and optionally workspaces.

```bash
openclaw backup create
openclaw backup create --output ~/Backups
openclaw backup create --dry-run --json
openclaw backup create --verify
openclaw backup create --no-include-workspace
openclaw backup create --only-config
openclaw backup verify ./2026-03-09T00-00-00.000Z-openclaw-backup.tar.gz
```

## Notes

- The archive includes a `manifest.json` file with the resolved source paths and archive layout.
- Default output is a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive in the current working directory.
- If the current working directory is inside a backed-up source tree, OpenClaw falls back to your home directory for the default archive location.
- Existing archive files are never overwritten.
- Output paths inside the source state/workspace trees are rejected to avoid self-inclusion.
- `openclaw backup verify <archive>` validates that the archive contains exactly one root manifest, rejects traversal-style archive paths, and checks that every manifest-declared payload exists in the tarball.
- `openclaw backup create --verify` runs that validation immediately after writing the archive.
- `openclaw backup create --only-config` backs up just the active JSON config file.

## What gets backed up

`openclaw backup create` plans backup sources from your local OpenClaw install:

- The state directory returned by OpenClaw's local state resolver, usually `~/.openclaw`
- The active config file path
- The resolved `credentials/` directory when it exists outside the state directory
- Workspace directories discovered from the current config, unless you pass `--no-include-workspace`

Model auth profiles are already part of the state directory under
`agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`, so they are normally covered by the
state backup entry.

If you use `--only-config`, OpenClaw skips state, credentials-directory, and worksp

## Migrate CLI (openclaw migrate)

# `openclaw migrate`

Import state from another agent system through a plugin-owned migration provider. Bundled providers cover [Claude](/install/migrating-claude) and [Hermes](/install/migrating-hermes); third-party plugins can register additional providers.

For user-facing walkthroughs, see [Migrating from Claude](/install/migrating-claude) and [Migrating from Hermes](/install/migrating-hermes). The [migration hub](/install/migrating) lists all paths.

## Commands

```bash
openclaw migrate list
openclaw migrate claude --dry-run
openclaw migrate hermes --dry-run
openclaw migrate hermes
openclaw migrate apply claude --yes
openclaw migrate apply hermes --yes
openclaw migrate apply hermes --include-secrets --yes
openclaw onboard --flow import
openclaw onboard --import-from claude --import-source ~/.claude
openclaw onboard --import-from hermes --import-source ~/.hermes
```
