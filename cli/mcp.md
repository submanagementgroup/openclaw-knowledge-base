`openclaw mcp` has two jobs:

- run OpenClaw as an MCP server with `openclaw mcp serve`
- manage OpenClaw-owned outbound MCP server definitions with `list`, `show`, `set`, and `unset`

In other words:

- `serve` is OpenClaw acting as an MCP server
- `list` / `show` / `set` / `unset` is OpenClaw acting as an MCP client-side registry for other MCP servers its runtimes may consume later

Use [`openclaw acp`](/cli/acp) when OpenClaw should host a coding harness session itself and route that runtime through ACP.

## OpenClaw as an MCP server

This is the `openclaw mcp serve` path.

### When to use `serve`

Use `openclaw mcp serve` when:

- Codex, Claude Code, or another MCP client should talk directly to OpenClaw-backed channel conversations
- you already have a local or remote OpenClaw Gateway with routed sessions
- you want one MCP server that works across OpenClaw's channel backends instead of running separate per-channel bridges

Use [`openclaw acp`](/cli/acp) instead when OpenClaw should host the coding runtime itself and keep the agent session inside OpenClaw.

### How it works

`openclaw mcp serve` starts a stdio MCP server. The MCP client owns that process. While the client keeps the stdio session open, the bridge connects to a local or remote OpenClaw Gateway over WebSocket and exposes routed channel conversations over MCP.

**Client spawns the bridge**

The MCP client spawns `openclaw mcp serve`.
  
**Bridge connects to Gateway**

The bridge connects to the OpenClaw Gateway over WebSocket.
  
**Sessions become MCP conversations**

Routed sessions become MCP conversations and transcript/history tools.
  
**Live events queue**

Live events are queued in memory while the bridge is connected.
  
**Optional Claude push**

If Claude channel mode is enabled, the same session can also receive Claude-specific push notifications.
  
### Important behavior

- live queue state starts when the bridge connects
    - older transcript history is read with `messages_read`
    - Claude push notifications only exist while the MCP session is alive
    - when the client disconnects, the bridge exits and the live queue is gone
    - one-shot agent entry points such as `openclaw agent` and `openclaw infer model run` retire any bundled MCP runtimes they open when the reply completes, so repeated scripted runs do not accumulate stdio MCP child processes
    - stdio MCP servers launched by OpenClaw (bundled or user-configured) are torn down as a process tree on shutdown, so child subprocesses started by the server do not survive after the parent stdio client exits
    - deleting or resetting a session disposes that session's MCP clients through the shared runtime cleanup path, so there are no lingering stdio connections tied to a removed session

  ### Choose a client mode

Use the same bridge in two different ways:

**Generic MCP clients:**

Standard MCP tools only. Use `conversations_list`, `messages_read`, `events_poll`, `events_wait`, `messages_send`, and the approval tools.
  
**Claude Code:**

Standard MCP tools plus the Claude-specific channel adapter. Enable `--claude-channel-mode on` or leave the default `auto`.
  
> **Note:** Today, `auto` behaves the same as `on`. There is no client capability detection yet.


### What `serve` exposes

The bridge uses existing Gateway session route metadata to expose channel-backed conversations. A conversation appears when OpenClaw already has session state with a known route such as:

- `channel`
- recipient or destination metadata
- optional `accountId`
- optional `threadId`

This gives MCP clients one place to:

- list recent routed conversations
- read recent transcript history
- wait for new inbound events
- send a reply back through the same route
- see approval requests that arrive while the bridge is connected

### Usage

**Local Gateway:**

```bash
    openclaw mcp serve
    ```
  
**Remote Gateway (token):**

```bash
    openclaw mcp serve --url wss://gateway-host:18789 --token-file ~/.openclaw/gateway.token
    ```
  
**Remote Gateway (password):**

```bash
    openclaw mcp serve --url wss://gateway-host:18789 --password-file ~/.openclaw/gateway.password
    ```
  
**Verbose / Claude off:**

```bash
    openclaw mcp serve --verbose
    openclaw mcp serve --claude-channel-mode off
    ```
  
### Bridge tools

The current bridge exposes these MCP tools:

### conversations_list

Lists recent session-backed conversations that already have route metadata in Gateway session state.

    Useful filters:

    - `limit`
    - `search`
    - `channel`
    - `includeDerivedTitles`
    - `includeLastMessage`

  ### conversation_get

Returns one conversation by `session_key` using a direct Gateway session lookup.
  ### messages_read

Reads recent transcript messages for one session-backed conversation.
  ### attachments_fetch

Extracts non-text message content blocks from one transcript message. This is a metadata view over transcript content, not a standalone durable attachment blob store.
  ### events_poll

Reads queued live events since a numeric cursor.
  ### events_wait

Long-polls until the next matching queued event arrives or a timeout expires.

    Use this when a generic MCP client needs near-real-time delivery without a Claude-specific push protocol.

  ### messages_send

Sends text back through the same route already recorded on the session.

    Current behavior:

    - requires an existing conversation route
    - uses the session's channel, recipient, account id, and thread id
    - sends text only

  ### permissions_list_open

Lists pending exec/plugin approval requests the bridge has observed since it connected to the Gateway.
  ### permissions_respond

Resolves one pending exec/plugin approval request with:

    - `allow-once`
    - `allow-always`
    - `deny`

  ### Event model

The bridge keeps an in-memory event queue while it is connected.

Current event types:

- `message`
- `exec_approval_requested`
- `exec_approval_resolved`
- `plugin_approval_requested`
- `plugin_approval_resolved`
- `claude_permission_request`

> **Note:** - the queue is live-only; it starts when the MCP bridge starts
- `events_poll` and `events_wait` do not replay older Gateway history by themselves
- durable backlog should be read with `messages_read`



### Claude channel notifications

The bridge can also expose Claude-specific channel notifications. This is the OpenClaw equivalent of a Claude Code channel adapter: standard MCP tools remain available, but live inbound messages can also arrive as Claude-specific MCP notifications.

**off:**

`--claude-channel-mode off`: standard MCP tools only.
  
**on:**

`--claude-channel-mode on`: enable Claude channel notifications.
  
**auto (default):**

`--claude-channel-mode auto`: current default; same bridge behavior as `on`.
  
When Claude channel mode is enabled, the server advertises Claude experimental capabilities and can emit:

- `notifications/claude/channel`
- `notifications/claude/channel/permission`

Current bridge behavior:

- inbound `user` transcript messages are forwarded as `notifications/claude/channel`
- Claude permission requests received over MCP are tracked in-memory
- if the linked conversation later sends `yes abcde` or `no abcde`, the bridge converts that to `notifications/claude/channel/permission`
- these notifications are live-session only; if the MCP client disconnects, there is no push target

This is intentionally client-specific. Generic MCP clients should rely on the standard polling tools.

### MCP client config

Example stdio client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openclaw": {
      "command": "openclaw",
      "args": [
        "mcp",
        "serve",
        "--url",
        "wss://gateway-host:18789",
        "--token-file",
        "/path/to/gateway.token"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For most generic MCP clients, start with the standard tool surface and ignore Claude mode. Turn Claude mode on only for clients that actually understand the Claude-specific notification methods.

### Options

`openclaw mcp serve` supports:


  Gateway WebSocket URL.


  Gateway token.


  Read token from file.


  Gateway password.


  Read password from file.


  Claude notification mode.


  Verbose logs on stderr.


> **Note:** Prefer `--token-file` or `--password-file` over inline secrets when possible.


### Security and trust boundary

The bridge does not invent routing. It only exposes conversations that Gateway already knows how to route.

That means:

- sender allowlists, pairing, and channel-level trust still belong to the underlying OpenClaw channel configuration
- `messages_send` can only reply through an existing stored route
- approval state is live/in-memory only for the current bridge session
- bridge auth should use the same Gateway token or password controls you would trust for any other remote Gateway client

If a conversation is missing from `conversations_list`, the usual cause is not MCP configuration. It is missing or incomplete route metadata in the underlying Gateway session.

### Testing

OpenClaw ships a deterministic Docker smoke for this bridge:

```bash
pnpm test:docker:mcp-channels
```

That smoke:

- starts a seeded Gateway container
- starts a second container that spawns `openclaw mcp serve`
- verifies conversation discovery, transcript reads, attachment metadata reads, live event queue behavior, and outbound send routing
- validates Claude-style channel and permission notifications over the real stdio MCP bridge

This is the fastest way to prove the bridge works without wiring a real Telegram, Discord, or iMessage account into the test run.

For broader testing context, see [Testing](/help/testing).

### Troubleshooting

### No conversations returned

Usually means the Gateway session is not already routable. Confirm that the underlying session has stored channel/provider, recipient, and optional account/thread route metadata.
  ### events_poll or events_wait misses older messages

Expected. The live queue starts when the bridge connects. Read older transcript history with `messages_read`.
  ### Claude notifications do not show up

Check all of these:

    - the client kept the stdio MCP session open
    - `--claude-channel-mode` is `on` or `auto`
    - the client actually understands the Claude-specific notification methods
    - the inbound message happened after the bridge connected

  ### Approvals are missing

`permissions_list_open` only shows approval requests observed while the bridge was connected. It is not a durable approval history API.
  ## OpenClaw as an MCP client registry

This is the `openclaw mcp list`, `show`, `set`, and `unset` path.

These commands do not expose OpenClaw over MCP. They manage OpenClaw-owned MCP server definitions under `mcp.servers` in OpenClaw config.

Those saved definitions are for runtimes that OpenClaw launches or configures later, such as embedded Pi and other runtime adapters. OpenClaw stores the definitions centrally so those runtimes do not need to keep their own duplicate MCP server lists.

### Important behavior

- these commands only read or write OpenClaw config
    - they do not connect to the target MCP server
    - they do not validate whether the command, URL, or remote transport is reachable right now
    - runtime adapters decide which transport shapes they actually support at execution time
    - embedded Pi exposes configured MCP tools in normal `coding` and `messaging` tool profiles; `minimal` still hides them, and `tools.deny: ["bundle-mcp"]` disables them explicitly
    - session-scoped bundled MCP runtimes are reaped after `mcp.sessionIdleTtlMs` milliseconds of idle time (default 10 minutes; set `0` to disable) and one-shot embedded runs clean them up at run end

  Runtime adapters may normalize this shared registry into the shape their downstream client expects. For example, embedded Pi consumes OpenClaw `transport` values directly, while Claude Code and Gemini receive CLI-native `type` va
