## Subcommands

- `status`: show service install state and probe Gateway health
- `install`: install service (`launchd`/`systemd`/`schtasks`)
- `uninstall`: remove service
- `start`: start service
- `stop`: stop service
- `restart`: restart service

## Common options

- `status`: `--url`, `--token`, `--password`, `--timeout`, `--no-probe`, `--require-rpc`, `--deep`, `--json`
- `install`: `--port`, `--runtime <node|bun>`, `--token`, `--force`, `--json`
- `restart`: `--safe`, `--skip-deferral`, `--force`, `--wait <duration>`, `--json`
- lifecycle (`uninstall|start|stop`): `--json`

Notes:

- `status` resolves configured auth SecretRefs for probe auth when possible.
- If a required auth SecretRef is unresolved in this command path, `daemon status --json` reports `rpc.authWarning` when probe connectivity/auth fails; pass `--token`/`--password` explicitly or resolve the secret source first.
- If the probe succeeds, unresolved auth-ref warnings are suppressed to avoid false positives.
- `status --deep` adds a best-effort system-level service scan. When it finds other gateway-like services, human output prints cleanup hints and warns that one gateway per machine is still the normal recommendation.
- `status --deep` also runs config validation in plugin-aware mode and surfaces configured plugin manifest warnings (for example missing channel config metadata) so install and update smoke checks catch them. Default `status` keeps the fast read-only path that skips plugin validation.
- On Linux systemd installs, `status` token-drift checks include both `Environment=` and `EnvironmentFile=` unit sources.
- Drift checks resolve `gateway.auth.token` SecretRefs using merged runtime env (service command env first, then process env fallback).
- If token auth is not effectively active (explicit `gateway.auth.mode` of `password`/`none`/`trusted-proxy`, or mode unset where password can win and no token candidate can win), token-drift checks skip config token resolution.
- When token auth requires a token and `gateway.auth.token` is SecretRef-managed, `install` validates that the SecretRef is resolvable but does not persist the resolved token into service environment metadata.
- If token auth requires a token and the configured token SecretRef is unresolved, install fails closed.
- If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, install is blocked until mode is set explicitly.
- On macOS, `install` keeps LaunchAgent plists owner-only and loads managed service environment values through an owner-only file and wrapper instead of serializing API keys or auth-profile env refs into `EnvironmentVariables`.
- If you intentionally run multiple gateways on one host, isolate ports, config/state, and workspaces; see [/gateway#multiple-gateways-same-host](/gateway#multiple-gateways-same-host).
- `restart --safe` asks the running Gateway to preflight active work and schedule one coalesced restart after active work drains. Plain `restart` keeps the existing service-manager behavior; `--force` remains the immediate override path.
- `restart --safe --skip-deferral` runs the OpenClaw-aware safe restart but bypasses the active-work deferral gate so the Gateway emits the restart immediately even when blockers are reported. Operator escape hatch when a stuck task run pins the safe restart; requires `--safe`.

## openclaw dashboard Command

# `openclaw dashboard`

Open the Control UI using your current auth.

```bash
openclaw dashboard
openclaw dashboard --no-open
```

Notes:

- `dashboard` resolves configured `gateway.auth.token` SecretRefs when possible.
- `dashboard` follows `gateway.tls.enabled`: TLS-enabled gateways print/open
  `https://` Control UI URLs and connect over `wss://`.
- If clipboard/browser delivery fails for a token-authenticated dashboard URL,
  `dashboard` logs a safe manual-auth hint naming `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`,
  `gateway.auth.token`, and fragment key `token` without printing the token
  value.
- For SecretRef-managed tokens (resolved or unresolved), `dashboard` prints/copies/opens a non-tokenized URL to avoid exposing external secrets in terminal output, clipboard history, or browser-launch arguments.
- If `gateway.auth.token` is SecretRef-managed but unresolved in this command path, the command prints a non-tokenized URL and explicit remediation guidance instead of embedding an invalid token placeholder.

## openclaw devices Command

# `openclaw devices`

Manage device pairing requests and device-scoped tokens.

## Commands

### `openclaw devices list`

List pending pairing requests and paired devices.

```
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices list --json
```

Pending request output shows the requested access next to the device's current
approved access when the device is already paired. This makes scope/role
upgrades explicit instead of looking like the pairing was lost.

### `openclaw devices remove <deviceId>`

Remove one paired device entry.

When you are authenticated with a paired device token, non-admin callers can
remove only **their own** device entry. Removing some other device requires
`operator.admin`.

```
openclaw devices remove <deviceId>
openclaw devices remove <deviceId> --json
```

### `openclaw devices clear --yes [--pending]`

Clear paired devices in bulk.

```
openclaw devices clear --yes
openclaw devices clear --yes --pending
openclaw devices clear --yes --pending --json
```

### `openclaw devices approve [requestId] [--latest]`

Approve a pending device pairing request by exact `requestId`. If `requestId`
is omitted or `--latest` is passed, OpenClaw only prints the selected pending
request and exits; rerun approval with the exact request ID after verifying
the details.

> **Note:** If a device retries pairing with changed auth details (role, scopes, or public key), OpenClaw supersedes the previous pending entry and issues a new `requestId`. Run `openclaw devices list` right before approval to use the current ID.


If the device is already paired and asks for broader scopes or a broader role,
OpenClaw keeps the existing approval in place and creates a new pending upgrade
request. Review the `Requested` vs `Approved` columns in `openclaw devices list`
or use `openclaw devices approve --latest` to preview the exact upgrade before
approving it.

If the Gateway is explicitly configured with
`gateway.nodes.pairing.autoApproveCidrs`, first-time `role: node` requests from
matching client IPs can be approved before they appear in this list. That policy
is disabled by default and never applies to operator/browser clients or upgrade
requests.

```
openclaw devices approve
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
openclaw devices approve --latest
```

### `openclaw devices reject <requestId>`

Reject a pending device pairing request.

```
openclaw devices reject <requestId>
```

### `openclaw devices rotate --device <id> --role <role> [--scope <scope...>]`

Rotate a device token for a specific role (optionally updating scopes).
The target role must already exist in that device's approved pairing contract;
rotation cannot mint a new unapproved role.
If you omit `--scope`, later reconnects with the stored rotated token reuse that
token's cached approved scopes. If you pass explicit `--scope` values, those
become the stored scope set for future cached-token reconnects.
Non-admin paired-device callers can rotate only their **own** device token.
The target token scope set must stay within the caller session's own operator
scopes; rotation cannot mint or preserve a broader operator token than the
caller already has.

```
openclaw devices rotate --device <deviceId> --role operator --scope operator.read --scope operator.write
```

Returns rotation metadata as JSON. If the caller is rotating its own token while
authenticated with that device token, the response also includes the replacement
token so the client can persist it before reconnecting. Shared/admin rotations
do not echo the bearer token.

### `openclaw devices revoke --device <id> --role <role>`

Revoke a device token for a specific role.

Non-admin paired-device callers can revoke only their **own** device token.
Revoking some other device's token requires `operator.admin`.
The target token scope set must also fit within the caller session's own
operator scopes; pairing-only callers cannot revoke admin/write operator tokens.

```
openclaw devices revoke --device <deviceId> --role node
```

Returns the revoke result as JSON.

## Common options

- `--url <url>`: Gateway WebSocket URL (defaults to `gateway.remote.url` when configured).
- `--token <token>`: Gateway token (if required).
- `--password <password>`: Gateway password (password auth).
- `--timeout <ms>`: RPC timeout.
- `--json`: JSON output (recommended for scripting).

> **Note:** When you set `--url`, the CLI does not fall back to config or environment credentials. Pass `--token` or `--password` explicitly. Missing explicit credentials is an error.


## Notes

- Token rotation returns a new token (sensitive). Treat it like a secret.
- These commands require `operator.pairing` (or `operator.admin`) scope. Some
  approvals also require the caller to hold the operator scopes that the target
  device would mint or inherit; see [Operator scopes](/gateway/operator-scopes).
- `gateway.nodes.pairing.autoApproveCidrs` is an opt-in Gateway policy for
  fresh node device pairing only; it does not change CLI approval authority.
- Token rotation and revocation stay inside the approved pairing role set and
  approved scope baseline for that device. A stray cached token entry does not
  grant a token-management target.
- For paired-device token sessions, cross-device management is admin-only:
  `remove`, `rotate`, and `revoke` are self-only unless the caller has
  `operator.admin`.
- Token mutation is also caller-scope contained: a pairing-only session cannot
  rotate or revoke a token that currently carries `operator.admin` or
  `operator.write`.
- `devices clear` is intentionally gated by `--yes`.
- If pairing scope is unavailable on local loopback (and no explicit `--url` is passed), list/approve can use a local pairing fallback.
- `devices approve` requires an explicit request ID before minting tokens; omitting `requestId` or passing `--latest` only previews the newest pending request.

## Token drift recovery checklist

Use this when Control UI or other clients keep failing with `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH`, `AUTH_DEVICE_TOKEN_MISMATCH`, or `AUTH_SCOPE_MISMATCH`.

1. Confirm current gateway token source:

```bash
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

2. List paired devices and identify the affected device id:

```bash
openclaw devices list
```

3. Rotate operator token for the affected device:

```bash
openclaw devices rotate --device <deviceId> --role operator
```

4. If rotation is not enough, remove stale pairing and approve again:

```bash
openclaw devices remove <deviceId>
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
```

5. Retry client connection with the current shared token/password.

Notes:

- Normal reconnect auth precedence is explicit shared token/password first, then explicit `deviceToken`, then stored device token, then bootstrap token.
- Trusted `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH` recovery can temporarily send both the shared token and the stored device token together for the one bounded retry.
- `AUTH_SCOPE_MISMATCH` means the device token was recognized but does not carry the requested scope set; fix the pairing/scope approval contract before changing shared gateway auth.

## openclaw directory Command

# `openclaw directory`

Directory lookups for channels that support it (contacts/peers, groups, and "me").

## Common flags

- `--channel <name>`: channel id/alias (required when multiple channels are configured; auto when only one is configured)
- `--account <id>`: account id (default: channel default)
- `--json`: output JSON

## Notes

- `directory` is meant to help you find IDs you can paste into other commands (especially `openclaw message send --target ...`).
- For many channels, results are config-backed (allowlists / configured groups) rather than a live provider directory.
- Installed channel plugins can still omit directory support; in that case the command reports the unsupported directory operation instead of reinstalling the plugin.
- Default output is `id` (and sometimes `name`) separated by a tab; use `--json` for scripting.

## Using results with `message send`

```bash
openclaw directory peers list --channel slack --query "U0"
openclaw message send --channel slack --target user:U012ABCDEF --message "hello"
```

## ID formats (by channel)

- WhatsApp: `+15551234567` (DM), `1234567890-1234567890@g.us` (group), `120363123456789@newsletter` (Channel/Newsletter outbound target)
- Telegram: `@username` or numeric chat id; groups are numeric ids
- Slack: `user:U…` and `channel:C…`
- Discord: `user:<id>` and `channel:<id>`
- Matrix (plugin): `user:@user:server`, `room:!roomId:server`, or `#alias:server`
- Microsoft Teams (plugin): `user:<id>` and `conversation:<id>`
- Zalo (plugin): user id (Bot API)
- Zalo Personal / `zalouser` (plugin): thread id (DM/group) from `zca` (`me`, `friend list`, `group list`)

## Self ("me")

```bash
openclaw directory self --channel zalouser
```

## Peers (contacts/users)

```bash
openclaw directory peers list --channel zalouser
openclaw directory peers list --channel zalouser --query "name"
openclaw directory peers list --channel zalouser --limit 50
```

## Groups

```bash
openclaw directory groups list --channel zalouser
openclaw directory groups list --channel zalouser --query "work"
openclaw directory groups members --channel zalouser --group-id <id>
```

## openclaw dns Command

# `openclaw dns`

DNS helpers for wide-area discovery (Tailscale + CoreDNS). Currently focused on macOS + Homebrew CoreDNS.

Related:

- Gateway discovery: [Discovery](/gateway/discovery)
- Wide-area discovery config: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)

## Setup

```bash
openclaw dns setup
openclaw dns setup --domain openclaw.internal
openclaw dns setup --apply
```

## `dns setup`

Plan or apply CoreDNS setup for unicast DNS-SD discovery.

Options:

- `--domain <domain>`: wide-area discovery domain (for example `openclaw.internal`)
- `--apply`: install or update CoreDNS config and restart the service (requires sudo; macOS only)

What it shows:

- resolved discovery domain
- zone file path
- current tailnet IPs
- recommended `openclaw.json` discovery config
- the Tailscale Split DNS nameserver/domain values to set

Notes:

- Without `--apply`, the command is a planning helper only and prints the recommended setup.
- If `--domain` is omitted, OpenClaw uses `discovery.wideArea.domain` from config.
- `--apply` currently supports macOS only and expects Homebrew CoreDNS.
- `--apply` bootstraps the zone file if needed, ensures the CoreDNS import stanza exists, and restarts the `coredns` brew service.
