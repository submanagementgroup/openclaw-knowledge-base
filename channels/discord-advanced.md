Discord advanced features: role-based routing, forum channels, interactive components, voice channels, and troubleshooting.

claw config patch --file ./discord.patch.json5 --dry-run` and then rerun without `--dry-run`. Plaintext `token` values are supported. SecretRef values are also supported for `channels.discord.token` across env/file/exec providers. See [Secrets Management](/gateway/secrets).

        For multiple Discord bots, keep each bot token and application ID under its account. A top-level `channels.discord.applicationId` is inherited by accounts, so only set it there when every account should use the same application ID.

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      accounts: {
        personal: {
          token: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "DISCORD_PERSONAL_TOKEN" },
          applicationId: "111111111111111111",
        },
        work: {
          token: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "DISCORD_WORK_TOKEN" },
          applicationId: "222222222222222222",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

    Wait until the gateway is running, then DM your bot in Discord. It will respond with a pairing code.

        Send the pairing code to your agent on your existing channel:

        > "Approve this Discord pairing code: `<CODE>`"

```bash
openclaw pairing list discord
openclaw pairing approve discord <CODE>
```

    Pairing codes expire after 1 hour.

    You should now be able to chat with your agent in Discord via DM.

Token resolution is account-aware. Config token values win over env fallback. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is only used for the default account.
If two enabled Discord accounts resolve to the same bot token, OpenClaw starts only one gateway monitor for that token. A config-sourced token wins over the default env fallback; otherwise the first enabled account wins and the duplicate account is reported disabled.
For advanced outbound calls (message tool/channel actions), an explicit per-call `token` is used for that call. This applies to send and read/probe-style actions (for example read/search/fetch/thread/pins/permissions). Account policy/retry settings still come from the selected account in the active runtime snapshot.

## Recommended: Set up a guild workspace

Once DMs are working, you can set up your Discord server as a full workspace where each channel gets its own agent session with its own context. This is recommended for private servers where it's just you and your bot.

    This enables your agent to respond in any channel on your server, not just DMs.

        > "Add my Discord Server ID `<server_id>` to the guild allowlist"

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      guilds: {
        YOUR_SERVER_ID: {
          requireMention: true,
          users: ["YOUR_USER_ID"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

    By default, your agent only responds in guild channels when @mentioned. For a private server, you probably want it to respond to every message.

    In guild channels, normal assistant final replies stay private by default. Visible Discord output must be sent explicitly with the `message` tool, so the agent can lurk by default and only post when it decides a channel reply is useful.

        > "Allow my agent to respond on this server without having to be @mentioned"

        Set `requireMention: false` in your guild config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      guilds: {
        YOUR_SERVER_ID: {
          requireMention: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

        To restore legacy automatic final replies for group/channel rooms, set `messages.groupChat.visibleReplies: "automatic"`.

    By default, long-term memory (MEMORY.md) only loads in DM sessions. Guild channels do not auto-load MEMORY.md.

        > "When I ask questions in Discord channels, use memory_search or memory_get if you need long-term context from MEMORY.md."

        If you need shared context in every channel, put the stable instructions in `AGENTS.md` or `USER.md` (they are injected for every session). Keep long-term notes in `MEMORY.md` and access them on demand with memory tools.

Now create some channels on your Discord server and start chatting. Your agent can see the channel name, and each channel gets its own isolated session — so you can set up `#coding`, `#home`, `#research`, or whatever fits your workflow.

## Runtime model

- Gateway owns the Discord connection.
- Reply routing is deterministic: Discord inbound replies back to Discord.
- Discord guild/channel metadata is added to the model prompt as untrusted
  context, not as a user-visible reply prefix. If a model copies that envelope
  back, OpenClaw strips the copied metadata from outbound replies and from
  future replay context.
- By default (`session.dmScope=main`), direct chats share the agent main session (`agent:main:main`).
- Guild channels are isolated session keys (`agent:<agentId>:discord:channel:<channelId>`).
- Group DMs are ignored by default (`channels.discord.dm.groupEnabled=false`).
- Native slash commands run in isolated command sessions (`agent:<agentId>:discord:slash:<userId>`), while still carrying `CommandTargetSessionKey` to the routed conversation session.
- Text-only cron/heartbeat announce delivery to Discord uses the final
  assistant-visible answer once. Media and structured component payloads remain
  multi-message when the agent emits multiple deliverable payloads.

## Forum channels

Discord forum and media channels only accept thread posts. OpenClaw supports two ways to create them:

- Send a message to the forum parent (`channel:<forumId>`) to auto-create a thread. The thread title uses the first non-empty line of your message.
- Use `openclaw message thread create` to create a thread directly. Do not pass `--message-id` for forum channels.

Example: send to forum parent to create a thread

```bash
openclaw message send --channel discord --target channel:<forumId> \
  --message "Topic title\nBody of the post"
```

Example: create a forum thread explicitly

```bash
openclaw message thread create --channel discord --target channel:<forumId> \
  --thread-name "Topic title" --message "Body of the post"
```

Forum parents do not accept Discord components. If you need components, send to the thread itself (`channel:<threadId>`).

## Interactive components

OpenClaw supports Discord components v2 containers for agent messages. Use the message tool with a `components` payload. Interaction results are routed back to the agent as normal inbound messages and follow the existing Discord `replyToMode` settings.

Supported blocks:

- `text`, `section`, `separator`, `actions`, `media-gallery`, `file`
- Action rows allow up to 5 buttons or a single select menu
- Select types: `string`, `user`, `role`, `mentionable`, `channel`

By default, components are single use. Set `components.reusable=true` to allow buttons, selects, and forms to be used multiple times until they expire.

To restrict who can click a button, set `allowedUsers` on that button (Discord user IDs, tags, or `*`). When configured, unmatched us
