Group message handling and broadcast groups in OpenClaw. Controls how the agent behaves in group chats, including mention requirements and broadcast targets.

## Group Configuration

OpenClaw treats group chats consistently across surfaces: Discord, iMessage, Matrix, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Zalo.

## Beginner intro (2 minutes)

OpenClaw "lives" on your own messaging accounts. There is no separate WhatsApp bot user. If **you** are in a group, OpenClaw can see that group and respond there.

Default behavior:

- Groups are restricted (`groupPolicy: "allowlist"`).
- Replies require a mention unless you explicitly disable mention gating.
- Normal final replies in groups/channels are private by default. Visible room output uses the `message` tool.

Translation: allowlisted senders can trigger OpenClaw by mentioning it.

**TL;DR**

- **DM access** is controlled by `*.allowFrom`.
- **Group access** is controlled by `*.groupPolicy` + allowlists (`*.groups`, `*.groupAllowFrom`).
- **Reply triggering** is controlled by mention gating (`requireMention`, `/activation`).

Quick flow (what happens to a group message):

```
groupPolicy? disabled -> drop
groupPolicy? allowlist -> group allowed? no -> drop
requireMention? yes -> mentioned? no -> store for context only
otherwise -> reply
```

## Visible replies

For group/channel rooms, OpenClaw defaults to `messages.groupChat.visibleReplies: "message_tool"`.
That means the agent still processes the turn and can update memory/session state, but its normal final answer is not automatically posted back into the room. To speak visibly, the agent uses `message(action=send)`.

For direct chats and any other source turn, use `messages.visibleReplies: "message_tool"` to apply the same tool-only visible-reply behavior globally. `messages.groupChat.visibleReplies` remains the more specific override for group/channel rooms.

This replaces the old pattern of forcing the model to answer `NO_REPLY` for most lurk-mode turns. In tool-only mode, doing nothing visible simply means not calling the message tool.

Typing indicators are still sent while the agent works in tool-only mode. The default group typing mode is upgraded from "message" to "instant" for these turns because there may never be normal assistant message text before the agent decides whether to call the message tool. Explicit typing-mode config still wins.

To restore legacy automatic final replies for group/channel rooms:

```json5
{
  messages: {
    groupChat: {
      visibleReplies: "automatic",
    },
  },
}
```

To require visible output to go through the message tool for every source chat:

```json5
{
  messages: {
    visibleReplies: "message_tool",
  },
}
```

Native slash commands (Discord, Telegram, and other surfaces with native command support) bypass `visibleReplies: "message_tool"` and always reply visibly so the channel-native command UI gets the response it expects. This applies to validated native command turns only; text-typed `/...` commands and ordinary chat turns still follow the configured group default.

## Context visibility and allowlists

Two different controls are involved in group safety:

- **Trigger authorization**: who can trigger the agent (`groupPolicy`, `groups`, `groupAllowFrom`, channel-specific allowlists).
- **Context visibility**: what supplemental context is injected into the model (reply text, quotes, thread history, forwarded metadata).

By default, OpenClaw prioritizes normal chat behavior and keeps context mostly as received. This means allowlists primarily decide who can trigger actions, not a universal redaction boundary for every quoted or historical snippet.

    - Some channels already apply sender-based filtering for supplemental context in specific paths (for example Slack thread seeding, Matrix reply/thread lookups).
    - Other channels still pass quote/reply/forward context through as received.

    - `contextVisibility: "all"` (default) keeps current as-received behavior.
    - `contextVisibility: "allowlist"` filters supplemental context to allowlisted senders.
    - `contextVisibility: "allowlist_quote"` is `allowlist` plus one explicit quote

## Broadcast Groups

**Status:** Experimental. Added in 2026.1.9.

## Overview

Broadcast Groups enable multiple agents to process and respond to the same message simultaneously. This allows you to create specialized agent teams that work together in a single WhatsApp group or DM — all using one phone number.

Current scope: **WhatsApp only** (web channel).

Broadcast groups are evaluated after channel allowlists and group activation rules. In WhatsApp groups, this means broadcasts happen when OpenClaw would normally reply (for example: on mention, depending on your group settings).

## Use cases

    Deploy multiple agents with atomic, focused responsibilities:

    ```
    Group: "Development Team"
    Agents:
      - CodeReviewer (reviews code snippets)
      - DocumentationBot (generates docs)
      - SecurityAuditor (checks for vulnerabilities)
      - TestGenerator (suggests test cases)
    ```

    Each agent processes the same message and provides its specialized perspective.

    ```
    Group: "International Support"
    Agents:
      - Agent_EN (responds in English)
      - Agent_DE (responds in German)
      - Agent_ES (responds in Spanish)
    ```

    ```
    Group: "Customer Support"
    Agents:
      - SupportAgent (provides answer)
      - QAAgent (reviews quality, only responds if issues found)
    ```

    ```
    Group: "Project Management"
    Agents:
      - TaskTracker (updates task database)
      - TimeLogger (logs time spent)
      - ReportGenerator (creates summaries)
    ```

## Configuration

### Basic setup

Add a top-level `broadcast` section (next to `bindings`). Keys are WhatsApp peer ids:

- group chats: group JID (e.g. `120363403215116621@g.us`)
- DMs: E.164 phone number (e.g. `+15551234567`)

```json
{
  "broadcast": {
    "120363403215116621@g.us": ["alfred", "baerbel", "assistant3"]
  }
}
```

**Result:** When OpenClaw would reply in this chat, it will run all three agents.

### Processing strategy

Control how agents process messages:

    All agents process simultaneously:

    ```json
    {
      "broadcast": {
        "strategy": "parallel",
        "120363403215116621@g.us": ["alfred", "baerbel"]
      }
    }
    ```

    Agents process in order (one waits for previous to finish):

    ```json
    {
      "broadcast": {
        "strategy": "sequential",
        "120363403215116621@g.us": ["alfred", "baerbel"]
      }
    }
    ```

### Complete example

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "code-reviewer",
        "name": "Code Reviewer",
        "workspace": "/path/to/code-reviewer",
        "sandbox": { "mode": "all" }
      },
      {
        "id": "security-auditor",
        "name": "Security Auditor",
        "workspace": "/path/to/security-auditor",
        "sandbox": { "mode": "all" }
      },
      {
        "id": "docs-generator",
        "name": "Documentation Generator",
        "workspace": "/path/to/docs-generator",
        "sandbox": { "mode": "all" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "broadcast": {


## Group Message Handling

Goal: let Clawd sit in WhatsApp groups, wake up only when pinged, and keep that thread separate from the personal DM session.

`agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns` is also used by Telegram, Discord, Slack, and iMessage. This doc focuses on WhatsApp-specific behavior. For multi-agent setups, set `agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns` per agent, or use `messages.groupChat.mentionPatterns` as a global fallback.

## Current implementation (2025-12-03)

- Activation modes: `mention` (default) or `always`. `mention` requires a ping (real WhatsApp @-mentions via `mentionedJids`, safe regex patterns, or the bot’s E.164 anywhere in the text). `always` wakes the agent on every message but it should reply only when it can add meaningful value; otherwise it returns the exact silent token `NO_REPLY` / `no_reply`. Defaults can be set in config (`channels.whatsapp.groups`) and overridden per group via `/activation`. When `channels.whatsapp.groups` is set, it also acts as a group allowlist (include `"*"` to allow all).
- Group policy: `channels.whatsapp.groupPolicy` controls whether group messages are accepted (`open|disabled|allowlist`). `allowlist` uses `channels.whatsapp.groupAllowFrom` (fallback: explicit `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom`). Default is `allowlist` (blocked until you add senders).
- Per-group sessions: session keys look like `agent:<agentId>:whatsapp:group:<jid>` so commands such as `/verbose on`, `/trace on`, or `/think high` (sent as standalone messages) are scoped to that group; personal DM state is untouched. Heartbeats are skipped for group threads.
- Context injection: **pending-only** group messages (default 50) that _did not_ trigger a run are prefixed under `[Chat messages since your last reply - for context]`, with the triggering line under `[Current message - respond to this]`. Messages already in the session are not re-injected.
- Sender surfacing: every group batch now ends with `[from: Sender Name (+E164)]` so Pi knows who is speaking.
- Ephemeral/view-once: we unwrap those before extracting text/mentions, so pings inside them still trigger.
- Group system prompt: on the first turn of a group session (and whenever `/activation` changes the mode) we inject a short blurb into the system prompt like `You are replying inside the WhatsApp group "<subject>". Group members: Alice (+44...), Bob (+43...), … Activation: trigger-only … Address the specific sender noted in the message context.` If metadata isn’t available we still tell the agent it’s a group chat.

## Config example (WhatsApp)

Add a `groupChat` block to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` so display-name pings work even when WhatsApp strips the visual `@` in the text body:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      groups: {
        "*": { requireMention: true },
      },
    },
  },
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "main",
        groupChat: {
          historyLimit: 50,
          mentionPatterns: ["@?openclaw", "\\+?15555550123"],
        },
      },
    ],
