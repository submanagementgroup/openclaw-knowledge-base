Platform-specific guides for Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, Oracle Cloud, and DigitalOcean.

## Linux

The Gateway is fully supported on Linux. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway (WhatsApp/Telegram bugs).

Native Linux companion apps are planned. Contributions are welcome if you want to help build one.

## Beginner quick path (VPS)

1. Install Node 24 (recommended; Node 22 LTS, currently `22.14+`, still works for compatibility)
2. `npm i -g openclaw@latest`
3. `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
4. From your laptop: `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 <user>@<host>`
5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` and authenticate with the configured shared secret (token by default; password if you set `gateway.auth.mode: "password"`)

Full Linux server guide: [Linux Server](/vps). Step-by-step VPS example: [exe.dev](/install/exe-dev)

## Install

- [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- [Install & updates](/install/updating)
- Optional flows: [Bun (experimental)](/install/bun), [Nix](/install/nix), [Docker](/install/docker)

## Gateway

- [Gateway runbook](/gateway)
- [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these:

```
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Or:

```
openclaw gateway install
```

Or:

```
openclaw configure
```

Select **Gateway service** when prompted.

Repair/migrate:

```
openclaw doctor
```

## System control (systemd user unit)

OpenClaw installs a systemd **user** service by default. Use a **system**
service for shared or always-on servers. `openclaw gateway install` and
`openclaw onboard --install-daemon` already render the current canonical unit
for you; write one by hand only when you need a custom system/service-manager
setup. The full service guidance lives in the [Gateway runbook](/gateway).

Minimal setup:

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=OpenClaw Gateway (profile: <profile>, v<version>)
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/openclaw gateway --port 18789
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
TimeoutStopSec=30
TimeoutStartSec=30
SuccessExitStatus=0 143
KillMode=control-group

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Enable it:

```
systemctl --user enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
```

## Memory pressure and OOM kills

On Linux, the kernel chooses an OOM victim when a host, VM, or container cgroup
runs out of memory. The Gateway can be a poor victim because it owns long-lived
sessions and channel connections. OpenClaw therefore biases transient child
processes to be killed before the Gateway when possible.

For eligible Linux child spawns, OpenClaw starts the child through a short
`/bin/sh` wrapper that raises the child's own `oom_score_adj` to `1000`, then
`exec`s the real command. This is an unprivileged operation because the child is
only increasing its own OOM kill likelihood.

Covered child process surfaces include:

- supervisor-managed command children,
- PTY shell children,
- MCP stdio server children,
- OpenClaw-launched browser/Chrome processes.

The wrapper is Linux-only and is skipped when `/bin/sh` is unavailable. It is
also skipped if the child env sets `OPENCLAW_CHILD_OOM_SCORE_ADJ=0`, `false`,
`no`, or `off`.

To verify a child process:

```bash
cat /proc/<child-pid>/oom_score_adj
```

Expected value for covered children is `1000`. The Gateway process should keep
its normal score, usually `0`.

This does not replace normal memory tuning. If a VPS or container repeatedly
kills children, increase the memory limit, reduce concurrency, or add stronger
resource controls such as systemd `MemoryMax=` or container-level memory limits.

## Windows

OpenClaw supports both **native Windows** and **WSL2**. WSL2 is the more
stable path and recommended for the full experience — the CLI, Gateway, and
tooling run inside Linux with full compatibility. Native Windows works for
core CLI and Gateway use, with some caveats noted below.

Native Windows companion apps are planned.

## WSL2 (recommended)

- [Getting Started](/start/getting-started) (use inside WSL)
- [Install & updates](/install/updating)
- Official WSL2 guide (Microsoft): [https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)

## Native Windows status

Native Windows CLI flows are improving, but WSL2 is still the recommended path.

What works well on native Windows today:

- website installer via `install.ps1`
- local CLI use such as `openclaw --version`, `openclaw doctor`, and `openclaw plugins list --json`
- embedded local-agent/provider smoke such as:

```powershell
openclaw agent --local --agent main --thinking low -m "Reply with exactly WINDOWS-HATCH-OK."
```

Current caveats:

- `openclaw onboard --non-interactive` still expects a reachable local gateway unless you pass `--skip-health`
- `openclaw onboard --non-interactive --install-daemon` and `openclaw gateway install` try Windows Scheduled Tasks first
- if Scheduled Task creation is denied, OpenClaw falls back to a per-user Startup-folder login item and starts the gateway immediately
- if `schtasks` itself wedges or stops responding, OpenClaw now aborts that path quickly and falls back instead of hanging forever
- Scheduled Tasks are still preferred when available because they provide better supervisor status

If you want the native CLI only, without gateway service install, use one of these:

```powershell
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --skip-health
openclaw gateway run
```

If you do want managed startup on native Windows:

```powershell
openclaw gateway install
openclaw gateway status --json
```

If Scheduled Task creation is blocked, the fallback service mode still auto-starts after login through the current user's Startup folder.

## Gateway

- [Gateway runbook](/gateway)
- [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Inside WSL2:

```
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Or:

```
openclaw gateway install
```

Or:

```
openclaw configure
```

Select **Gateway service** when prompted.

Repair/migrate:

```
openclaw doctor
```

## Gateway auto-start before Windows login

For headless setups, ensure the full boot chain runs even when no one logs into
Windows.

### 1) Keep user services running without login

Inside WSL:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(whoami)"
```

### 2) Install the OpenClaw gateway user service

Inside WSL:

```bash
openclaw gateway install
```

### 3) Start WSL automatically at Windows boot

In PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
schtasks /create /tn "WSL Boot" /tr "wsl.exe -d Ubuntu --exec /bin/true" /sc onstart /ru SYSTEM
```

Replace `Ubuntu` with your distro

## Raspberry Pi

# OpenClaw on Raspberry Pi

## Goal

Run a persistent, always-on OpenClaw Gateway on a Raspberry Pi for **~$35-80** one-time cost (no monthly fees).

Perfect for:

- 24/7 personal AI assistant
- Home automation hub
- Low-power, always-available Telegram/WhatsApp bot

## Hardware requirements

| Pi Model        | RAM     | Works?   | Notes                              |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Pi 5**        | 4GB/8GB | ✅ Best  | Fastest, recommended               |
| **Pi 4**        | 4GB     | ✅ Good  | Sweet spot for most users          |
| **Pi 4**        | 2GB     | ✅ OK    | Works, add swap                    |
| **Pi 4**        | 1GB     | ⚠️ Tight | Possible with swap, minimal config |
| **Pi 3B+**      | 1GB     | ⚠️ Slow  | Works but sluggish                 |
| **Pi Zero 2 W** | 512MB   | ❌       | Not recommended                    |

**Minimum specs:** 1GB RAM, 1 core, 500MB disk  
**Recommended:** 2GB+ RAM, 64-bit OS, 16GB+ SD card (or USB SSD)

## What you need

- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (2GB+ recommended)
- MicroSD card (16GB+) or USB SSD (better performance)
- Power supply (official Pi PSU recommended)
- Network connection (Ethernet or WiFi)
- ~30 minutes

## 1) Flash the OS

Use **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** — no desktop needed for a headless server.

1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Choose OS: **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**
3. Click the gear icon (⚙️) to pre-configure:
   - Set hostname: `gateway-host`
   - Enable SSH
   - Set username/password
   - Configure WiFi (if not using Ethernet)
4. Flash to your SD card / USB drive
5. Insert and boot the Pi

## 2) Connect via SSH

```bash
ssh user@gateway-host
# or use the IP address
ssh user@192.168.x.x
```

## 3) System Setup

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential packages
sudo apt install -y git curl build-essential

# Set timezone (important for cron/reminders)
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Chicago  # Change to your timezone
```

## 4) Install Node.js 24 (ARM64)

```bash
# Install Node.js via NodeSource
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Verify
node --version  # Should show v24.x.x
npm --version
```

## 5) Add Swap (Important for 2GB or less)

Swap prevents out-of-memory crashes:

```bash
# Create 2GB swap file
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Make permanent
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Optimize for low RAM (reduce swappiness)
echo 'vm.swappiness=10' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

## 6) Install OpenClaw

### Option A: standard install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Option B: hackable install (for tinkering)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
npm install
npm run b

## Oracle Cloud

# OpenClaw on Oracle Cloud (OCI)

## Goal

Run a persistent OpenClaw Gateway on Oracle Cloud's **Always Free** ARM tier.

Oracle’s free tier can be a great fit for OpenClaw (especially if you already have an OCI account), but it comes with tradeoffs:

- ARM architecture (most things work, but some binaries may be x86-only)
- Capacity and signup can be finicky

## Cost comparison (2026)

| Provider     | Plan            | Specs                  | Price/mo | Notes                 |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Oracle Cloud | Always Free ARM | up to 4 OCPU, 24GB RAM | $0       | ARM, limited capacity |
| Hetzner      | CX22            | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM        | ~ $4     | Cheapest paid option  |
| DigitalOcean | Basic           | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM        | $6       | Easy UI, good docs    |
| Vultr        | Cloud Compute   | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM        | $6       | Many locations        |
| Linode       | Nanode          | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM        | $5       | Now part of Akamai    |

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud account ([signup](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)) — see [community signup guide](https://gist.github.com/rssnyder/51e3cfedd730e7dd5f4a816143b25dbd) if you hit issues
- Tailscale account (free at [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com))
- ~30 minutes

## 1) Create an OCI Instance

1. Log into [Oracle Cloud Console](https://cloud.oracle.com/)
2. Navigate to **Compute → Instances → Create Instance**
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** `openclaw`
   - **Image:** Ubuntu 24.04 (aarch64)
   - **Shape:** `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` (Ampere ARM)
   - **OCPUs:** 2 (or up to 4)
   - **Memory:** 12 GB (or up to 24 GB)
   - **Boot volume:** 50 GB (up to 200 GB free)
   - **SSH key:** Add your public key
4. Click **Create**
5. Note the public IP address

**Tip:** If instance creation fails with "Out of capacity", try a different availability domain or retry later. Free tier capacity is limited.

## 2) Connect and Update

```bash
# Connect via public IP
ssh ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y build-essential
```

**Note:** `build-essential` is required for ARM compilation of some dependencies.

## 3) Configure User and Hostname

```bash
# Set hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname openclaw

# Set password for ubuntu user
sudo passwd ubuntu

# Enable lingering (keeps user services running after logout)
sudo loginctl enable-linger ubuntu
```

## 4) Install Tailscale

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up --ssh --hostname=openclaw
```

This enables Tailscale SSH, so you can connect via `ssh openclaw` from any device on your tailnet — no public IP needed.

Verify:

```bash
tailscale status
```

**From now on, connect via Tailscale:** `ssh ubuntu@openclaw` (or use the Tailscale IP).

## 5) Install OpenClaw

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

When prompted "How d

## DigitalOcean

# OpenClaw on DigitalOcean

## Goal

Run a persistent OpenClaw Gateway on DigitalOcean for **$6/month** (or $4/mo with reserved pricing).

If you want a $0/month option and don’t mind ARM + provider-specific setup, see the [Oracle Cloud guide](/platforms/oracle).

## Cost comparison (2026)

| Provider     | Plan            | Specs                  | Price/mo    | Notes                                 |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Oracle Cloud | Always Free ARM | up to 4 OCPU, 24GB RAM | $0          | ARM, limited capacity / signup quirks |
| Hetzner      | CX22            | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM        | €3.79 (~$4) | Cheapest paid option                  |
| DigitalOcean | Basic           | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM        | $6          | Easy UI, good docs                    |
| Vultr        | Cloud Compute   | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM        | $6          | Many locations                        |
| Linode       | Nanode          | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM        | $5          | Now part of Akamai                    |

**Picking a provider:**

- DigitalOcean: simplest UX + predictable setup (this guide)
- Hetzner: good price/perf (see [Hetzner guide](/install/hetzner))
- Oracle Cloud: can be $0/month, but is more finicky and ARM-only (see [Oracle guide](/platforms/oracle))
