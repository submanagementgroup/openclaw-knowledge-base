OpenClaw supports additive SecretRefs so supported credentials do not need to be stored as plaintext in configuration.

> **Note:** Plaintext still works. SecretRefs are opt-in per credential.


## Goals and runtime model

Secrets are resolved into an in-memory runtime snapshot.

- Resolution is eager during activation, not lazy on request paths.
- Startup fails fast when an effectively active SecretRef cannot be resolved.
- Reload uses atomic swap: full success, or keep the last-known-good snapshot.
- SecretRef policy violations (for example OAuth-mode auth profiles combined with SecretRef input) fail activation before runtime swap.
- Runtime requests read from the active in-memory snapshot only.
- After the first successful config activation/load, runtime code paths keep reading that active in-memory snapshot until a successful reload swaps it.
- Outbound delivery paths also read from that active snapshot (for example Discord reply/thread delivery and Telegram action sends); they do not re-resolve SecretRefs on each send.

This keeps secret-provider outages off hot request paths.

## Active-surface filtering

SecretRefs are validated only on effectively active surfaces.

- Enabled surfaces: unresolved refs block startup/reload.
- Inactive surfaces: unresolved refs do not block startup/reload.
- Inactive refs emit non-fatal diagnostics with code `SECRETS_REF_IGNORED_INACTIVE_SURFACE`.

### Examples of inactive surfaces

- Disabled channel/account entries.
    - Top-level channel credentials that no enabled account inherits.
    - Disabled tool/feature surfaces.
    - Web search provider-specific keys that are not selected by `tools.web.search.provider`. In auto mode (provider unset), keys are consulted by precedence for provider auto-detection until one resolves. After selection, non-selected provider keys are treated as inactive until selected.
    - Sandbox SSH auth material (`agents.defaults.sandbox.ssh.identityData`, `certificateData`, `knownHostsData`, plus per-agent overrides) is active only when the effective sandbox backend is `ssh` for the default agent or an enabled agent.
    - `gateway.remote.token` / `gateway.remote.password` SecretRefs are active if one of these is true:
      - `gateway.mode=remote`
      - `gateway.remote.url` is configured
      - `gateway.tailscale.mode` is `serve` or `funnel`
      - In local mode without those remote surfaces:
        - `gateway.remote.token` is active when token auth can win and no env/auth token is configured.
        - `gateway.remote.password` is active only when password auth can win and no env/auth password is configured.
    - `gateway.auth.token` SecretRef is inactive for startup auth resolution when `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set, because env token input wins for that runtime.

  ## Gateway auth surface diagnostics

When a SecretRef is configured on `gateway.auth.token`, `gateway.auth.password`, `gateway.remote.token`, or `gateway.remote.password`, gateway startup/reload logs the surface state explicitly:

- `active`: the SecretRef is part of the effective auth surface and must resolve.
- `inactive`: the SecretRef is ignored for this runtime because another auth surface wins, or because remote auth is disabled/not active.

These entries are logged with `SECRETS_GATEWAY_AUTH_SURFACE` and include the reason used by the active-surface policy, so you can see why a credential was treated as active or inactive.

## Onboarding reference preflight

When onboarding runs in interactive mode and you choose SecretRef storage, OpenClaw runs preflight validation before saving:

- Env refs: validates env var name and confirms a non-empty value is visible during setup.
- Provider refs (`file` or `exec`): validates provider selection, resolves `id`, and checks resolved value type.
- Quickstart reuse path: when `gateway.auth.token` is already a SecretRef, onboarding resolves it before probe/dashboard bootstrap (for `env`, `file`, and `exec` refs) using the same fail-fast gate.

If validation fails, onboarding shows the error and lets you retry.

## SecretRef contract

Use one object shape everywhere:

```json5
{ source: "env" | "file" | "exec", provider: "default", id: "..." }
```

**env:**

```json5
    { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "OPENAI_API_KEY" }
    ```

    Validation:

    - `provider` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`
    - `id` must match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{0,127}$`

  
**file:**

```json5
    { source: "file", provider: "filemain", id: "/providers/openai/apiKey" }
    ```

    Validation:

    - `provider` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`
    - `id` must be an absolute JSON pointer (`/...`)
    - RFC6901 escaping in segments: `~` => `~0`, `/` => `~1`

  
**exec:**

```json5
    { source: "exec", provider: "vault", id: "providers/openai/apiKey" }
    ```

    Validation:

    - `provider` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`
    - `id` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:/-]{0,255}$`
    - `id` must not contain `.` or `..` as slash-delimited path segments (for example `a/../b` is rejected)

  
## Provider config

Define providers under `secrets.providers`:

```json5
{
  secrets: {
    providers: {
      default: { source: "env" },
      filemain: {
        source: "file",
        path: "~/.openclaw/secrets.json",
        mode: "json", // or "singleValue"
      },
      vault: {
        source: "exec",
        command: "/usr/local/bin/openclaw-vault-resolver",
        args: ["--profile", "prod"],
        passEnv: ["PATH", "VAULT_ADDR"],
        jsonOnly: true,
      },
    },
    defaults: {
      env: "default",
      file: "filemain",
      exec: "vault",
    },
    resolution: {
      maxProviderConcurrency: 4,
      maxRefsPerProvider: 512,
      maxBatchBytes: 262144,
    },
  },
}
```

### Env provider

- Optional allowlist via `allowlist`.
    - Missing/empty env values fail resolution.

  ### File provider

- Reads local file from `path`.
    - `mode: "json"` expects JSON object payload and resolves `id` as pointer.
    - `mode: "singleValue"` expects ref id `"value"` and returns file contents.
    - Path must pass ownership/permission checks.
    - Windows fail-closed note: if ACL verification is unavailable for a path, resolution fails. For trusted paths only, set `allowInsecurePath: true` on that provider to bypass path security checks.

  ### Exec provider

- Runs configured absolute binary path, no shell.
    - By default, `command` must point to a regular file (not a symlink).
    - Set `allowSymlinkCommand: true` to allow symlink command paths (for example Homebrew shims). OpenClaw validates the resolved target path.
    - Pair `allowSymlinkCommand` with `trustedDirs` for package-manager paths (for example `["/opt/homebrew"]`).
    - Supports timeout, no-output timeout, output byte limits, env allowlist, and trusted dirs.
    - Windows fail-closed note: if ACL verification is unavailable for the command path, resolution fails. For trusted paths only, set `allowInsecurePath: true` on that provider to bypass path security checks.

    Request payload (stdin):

    ```json
    { "protocolVersion": 1, "provider": "vault", "ids": ["providers/openai/apiKey"] }
    ```

    Response payload (stdout):

    ```jsonc
    { "protocolVersion": 1, "values": { "providers/openai/apiKey": "<openai-api-key>" } } // pragma: allowlist secret
    ```

    Optional per-id errors:

    ```json
    {
      "protocolVersion": 1,
      "values": {},
      "errors": { "providers/openai/apiKey": { "message": "not found" } }
    }
    ```

            apiKey: { source: "exec", provider: "vault_openai", id: "value" },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```
  ### sops

```json5
    {
      secrets: {
        providers: {
          sops_openai: {
            source: "exec",
            command: "/opt/homebrew/bin/sops",
            allowSymlinkCommand: true, // required for Homebrew symlinked binaries

            passEnv: ["SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE"],
            jsonOnly: false,
          },
        },
      },
      models: {
        providers: {
          openai: {
            baseUrl: "https://api.openai.com/v1",
            models: [{ id: "gpt-5", name: "gpt-5" }],
            apiKey: { source: "exec", provider: "sops_openai", id: "value" },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```
  ## MCP server environment variables

MCP server env vars configured via `plugins.entries.acpx.config.mcpServers` support SecretInput. This keeps API keys and tokens out of plaintext config:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      acpx: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          mcpServers: {
            github: {
              command: "npx",
              args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
              env: {
                GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: {
                  source: "env",
                  provider: "default",
                  id: "MCP_GITHUB_PAT",
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Plaintext string values still work. Env-template refs like `${MCP_SERVER_API_KEY}` and SecretRef objects are resolved during gateway activation before the MCP server process is spawned. As with other SecretRef surfaces, unresolved refs only block activation when the `acpx` plugin is effectively active.

## Sandbox SSH auth material

The core `ssh` sandbox backend also supports SecretRefs for SSH auth material:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      sandbox: {
        mode: "all",
        backend: "ssh",
        ssh: {
          target: "user@gateway-host:22",
          identityData: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "SSH_IDENTITY" },
          certificateData: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "SSH_CERTIFICATE" },
          knownHostsData: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Runtime behavior:

- OpenClaw resolves these refs during sandbox activation, not lazily during each SSH call.
- Resolved values are written to temp files with restrictive permissions and used in generated SSH config.
- If the effective sandbox backend is not `ssh`, these refs stay inactive and do not block startup.
