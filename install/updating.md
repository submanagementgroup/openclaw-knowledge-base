Updating and uninstalling OpenClaw.

## Updating

Keep OpenClaw up to date.

## Recommended: `openclaw update`

The fastest way to update. It detects your install type (npm or git), fetches the latest version, runs `openclaw doctor`, and restarts the gateway.

```bash
openclaw update
```

To switch channels or target a specific version:

```bash
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel dev
openclaw update --tag main
openclaw update --dry-run   # preview without applying
```

`--channel beta` prefers beta, but the runtime falls back to stable/latest when
the beta tag is missing or older than the latest stable release. Use `--tag beta`
if you want the raw npm beta dist-tag for a one-off package update.

See [Development channels](/install/development-channels) for channel semantics.

## Switch between npm and git installs

Use channels when you want to change the install type. The updater keeps your
state, config, credentials, and workspace in `~/.openclaw`; it only changes
which OpenClaw code install the CLI and gateway use.

```bash
# npm package install -> editable git checkout
openclaw update --channel dev

# git checkout -> npm package install
openclaw update --channel stable
```

Run with `--dry-run` first to preview the exact install-mode switch:

```bash
openclaw update --channel dev --dry-run
openclaw update --channel stable --dry-run
```

The `dev` channel ensures a git checkout, builds it, and installs the global CLI
from that checkout. The `stable` and `beta` channels use package installs. If the
gateway is already installed, `openclaw update` refreshes the service metadata
and restarts it unless you pass `--no-restart`.

## Alternative: re-run the installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Add `--no-onboard` to skip onboarding. To force a specific install type through
the installer, pass `--install-method git --no-onboard` or
`--install-method npm --no-onboard`.

If `openclaw update` fails after the npm package install phase, re-run the
installer. The installer does not call the old updater; it runs the global
package install directly and can recover a partially updated npm install.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method npm
```

To pin the recovery to a specific version or dist-tag, add `--version`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method npm --version <version-or-dist-tag>
```

## Alternative: manual npm, pnpm, or bun

```bash
npm i -g openclaw@latest
```

When `openclaw update` manages a global npm install, it installs the target into
a temporary npm prefix first, verifies the packaged `dist` inventory, then swaps
the clean package tree into the real global prefix. That avoids npm overlaying a
new package onto stale files from the old package. If the install command fails,
OpenClaw retries once with `--omit=optional`. That retry helps hosts where native
optional dependencies cannot compile, while keeping the original failure visible
if the fallback also fails.

```bash
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

```bash
bun add -g openclaw@latest
```

### Advanced npm install topics

    OpenClaw treats packaged global installs as read-only at runtime, even when the global package directory is writable by the current user. Bundled plugin runtime dependencies are staged into a writable runtime directory instead of mutating the package tree. This keeps `openclaw update` from racing with a running gateway or local agent that is repairing plugin dependencies during the same install.

    Some Linux npm setups install global packages under root-owned directories such as `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw`. OpenClaw supports that layout through the same external staging path.

    Set a writable stage directory that is included in `ReadWritePaths`:

    ```ini
    Environment=OPENCLAW_PLUGIN_STAGE_DIR=/var/lib/openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps
    ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/openclaw /home/openclaw/.openclaw /tmp
    ```

    `OPENCLAW_PLUGIN_STAGE_DIR` also accepts a path list. OpenClaw resolves bundled plugin runtime dependencies left-to-right across the listed roots, treats earlier roots as read-only preinstalled layers, and installs or repairs only into the final writable root:

    ```ini
    Environment=OPENCLAW_PLUGIN_STAGE_DIR=/opt/openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps:/var/lib/openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps
    ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/openclaw /home/openclaw/.openclaw /tmp
    ```

    If `OPENCLAW_PLUGIN_STAGE_DIR` is not set, OpenClaw uses `$STATE_DIRECTORY` when systemd provides it, then falls back to `~/.openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps`. The repair step treats that stage as an OpenClaw-owned local package root and ignores user npm prefix and global settings, so global-install npm config does not redirect bundled plugin dependencies into `~/node_modules` or the global package tree.

    Before package updates and bundled runtime-dependency repairs, OpenClaw tries a best-effort disk-space check for the target volume. Low space produces a warning w

## Uninstalling

Two paths:

- **Easy path** if `openclaw` is still installed.
- **Manual service removal** if the CLI is gone but the service is still running.

## Easy path (CLI still installed)

Recommended: use the built-in uninstaller:

```bash
openclaw uninstall
```

Non-interactive (automation / npx):

```bash
openclaw uninstall --all --yes --non-interactive
npx -y openclaw uninstall --all --yes --non-interactive
```

Manual steps (same result):

1. Stop the gateway service:

```bash
openclaw gateway stop
```

2. Uninstall the gateway service (launchd/systemd/schtasks):

```bash
openclaw gateway uninstall
```

3. Delete state + config:

```bash
rm -rf "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}"
```

If you set `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` to a custom location outside the state dir, delete that file too.

4. Delete your workspace (optional, removes agent files):

```bash
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/workspace
```

5. Remove the CLI install (pick the one you used):

```bash
npm rm -g openclaw
pnpm remove -g openclaw
bun remove -g openclaw
```

6. If you installed the macOS app:

```bash
rm -rf /Applications/OpenClaw.app
```

Notes:

- If you used profiles (`--profile` / `OPENCLAW_PROFILE`), repeat step 3 for each state dir (defaults are `~/.openclaw-<profile>`).
- In remote mode, the state dir lives on the **gateway host**, so run steps 1-4 there too.

## Manual service removal (CLI not installed)

Use this if the gateway service keeps running but `openclaw` is missing.

### macOS (launchd)

Default label is `ai.openclaw.gateway` (or `ai.openclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.openclaw.*` may still exist):

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway
rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
```

If you used a profile, replace the label and plist name with `ai.openclaw.<profile>`. Remove any legacy `com.openclaw.*` plists if present.

### Linux (systemd user unit)

Default unit name is `openclaw-gateway.service` (or `openclaw-gateway-<profile>.service`):

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now openclaw-gateway.service
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

### Windows (Scheduled Task)

Default task name is `OpenClaw Gateway` (or `OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>)`).
The task script lives under your state dir.

```powershell
schtasks /Delete /F /TN "OpenClaw Gateway"
Remove-Item -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\gateway.cmd"
```

If you used a profile, delete the matching task name and `~\.openclaw-<profile>\gateway.cmd`.

## Normal install vs source checkout

### Normal install (install.sh / npm / pnpm / bun)

If you used `https://openclaw.ai/install.sh` or `install.ps1`, the CLI was installed with `npm install -g openclaw@latest`.
Remove it with `npm rm -g openclaw` (or `pnpm remove -g` / `bun remove -g` if you installed that way).

### Source checkout (git clone)

If you run from a repo checkout (`git clone` + `openclaw ...` / `bun run openclaw ...`):

1. Uninstall the gateway service **before** deleting the repo (use the easy path above or manual service removal).
2. Delete the repo directory.
3. Remove state + workspace as shown above.
