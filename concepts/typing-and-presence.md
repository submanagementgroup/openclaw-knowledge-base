Typing indicators signal that the agent is processing. Presence tracks agent availability state across channels.

## Typing Indicators

Typing indicators are sent to the chat channel while a run is active. Use
`agents.defaults.typingMode` to control **when** typing starts and `typingIntervalSeconds`
to control **how often** it refreshes.

## Defaults

When `agents.defaults.typingMode` is **unset**, OpenClaw keeps the legacy behavior:

- **Direct chats**: typing starts immediately once the model loop begins.
- **Group chats with a mention**: typing starts immediately.
- **Group chats without a mention**: typing starts only when message text begins streaming.
- **Heartbeat runs**: typing starts when the heartbeat run begins if the
  resolved heartbeat target is a typing-capable chat and typing is not disabled.

## Modes

Set `agents.defaults.typingMode` to one of:

- `never` — no typing indicator, ever.
- `instant` — start typing **as soon as the model loop begins**, even if the run
  later returns only the silent reply token.
- `thinking` — start typing on the **first reasoning delta** (requires
  `reasoningLevel: "stream"` for the run).
- `message` — start typing on the **first non-silent text delta** (ignores
  the `NO_REPLY` silent token).

Order of “how early it fires”:
`never` → `message` → `thinking` → `instant`

## Configuration

```json5
{
  agent: {
    typingMode: "thinking",
    typingIntervalSeconds: 6,
  },
}
```

You can override mode or cadence per session:

```json5
{
  session: {
    typingMode: "message",
    typingIntervalSeconds: 4,
  },
}
```

## Notes

- `message` mode won’t show typing for silent-only replies when the whole
  payload is the exact silent token (for example `NO_REPLY` / `no_reply`,
  matched case-insensitively).
- `thinking` only fires if the run streams reasoning (`reasoningLevel: "stream"`).
  If the model doesn’t emit reasoning deltas, typing won’t start.
- Heartbeat typing is a liveness signal for the resolved delivery target. It
  starts at heartbeat run start instead of following `message` or `thinking`
  stream timing. Set `typingMode: "never"` to disable it.
- Heartbeats do not show typing when `target: "none"`, when the target cannot
  be resolved, when chat delivery is disabled for the heartbeat, or when the
  channel does not support typing.
- `typingIntervalSeconds` controls the **refresh cadence**, not the start time.
  The default is 6 seconds.

## Presence

OpenClaw “presence” is a lightweight, best‑effort view of:

- the **Gateway** itself, and
- **clients connected to the Gateway** (mac app, WebChat, CLI, etc.)

Presence is used primarily to render the macOS app’s **Instances** tab and to
provide quick operator visibility.

## Presence fields (what shows up)

Presence entries are structured objects with fields like:

- `instanceId` (optional but strongly recommended): stable client identity (usually `connect.client.instanceId`)
- `host`: human‑friendly host name
- `ip`: best‑effort IP address
- `version`: client version string
- `deviceFamily` / `modelIdentifier`: hardware hints
- `mode`: `ui`, `webchat`, `cli`, `backend`, `probe`, `test`, `node`, ...
- `lastInputSeconds`: “seconds since last user input” (if known)
- `reason`: `self`, `connect`, `node-connected`, `periodic`, ...
- `ts`: last update timestamp (ms since epoch)

## Producers (where presence comes from)

Presence entries are produced by multiple sources and **merged**.

### 1) Gateway self entry

The Gateway always seeds a “self” entry at startup so UIs show the gateway host
even before any clients connect.

### 2) WebSocket connect

Every WS client begins with a `connect` request. On successful handshake the
Gateway upserts a presence entry for that connection.

#### Why one-off CLI commands do not show up

The CLI often connects for short, one‑off commands. To avoid spamming the
Instances list, `client.mode === "cli"` is **not** turned into a presence entry.

### 3) `system-event` beacons

Clients can send richer periodic beacons via the `system-event` method. The mac
app uses this to report host name, IP, and `lastInputSeconds`.

### 4) Node connects (role: node)

When a node connects over the Gateway WebSocket with `role: node`, the Gateway
upserts a presence entry for that node (same flow as other WS clients).

## Merge + dedupe rules (why `instanceId` matters)

Presence entries are stored in a single in‑memory map:

- Entries are keyed by a **presence key**.
- The best key is a stable `instanceId` (from `connect.client.instanceId`) that survives restarts.
- Keys are case‑insensitive.

If a client reconnects without a stable `instanceId`, it may show up as a
**duplicate** row.

## TTL and bounded size

Presence is intentionally ephemeral:

- **TTL:** entries older than 5 minutes are pruned
- **Max entries:** 200 (oldest dropped first)

This keeps the list fresh and avoids unbounded memory growth.

## Remote/tunnel caveat (loopback IPs)

When a client connects over an SSH tunnel / local port forward, the Gateway may
see the remote address as `127.0.0.1`. To avoid overwriting a good client‑reported
IP, loopback remote addresses are ignored.

## Consumers

### macOS Instances tab

The macOS app renders the output of `system-presence` and applies a small status
indicator (Active/Idle/Stale) based on the age of the last update.

## Debugging tips

- To see the raw list, call `system-presence` against the Gateway.
- If you see duplicates:
  - confirm clients send a stable `client.instanceId` in the handshake
  - confirm periodic beacons use the same `instanceId`
  - check whether the connection‑derived entry is missing `instanceId` (duplicates are expected)
