The OpenClaw SDK provides TypeScript APIs for building plugins, channel integrations, and provider extensions. It is the primary entry point for extending OpenClaw.

The **OpenClaw App SDK** is the public client API for apps outside the
OpenClaw process. Use `@openclaw/sdk` when a script, dashboard, CI job, IDE
extension, or other external app wants to connect to the Gateway, start agent
runs, stream events, wait for results, cancel work, or inspect Gateway
resources.

  The App SDK is different from the [Plugin SDK](/plugins/sdk-overview).
  `@openclaw/sdk` talks to the Gateway from outside OpenClaw.
  `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*` is only for plugins that run inside OpenClaw and
  register providers, channels, tools, hooks, or trusted runtimes.

## What Ships Today

`@openclaw/sdk` ships with:

| Surface                   | Status  | What it does                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OpenClaw`                | Ready   | Main client entry point. Owns transport, connection, requests, and events.   |
| `GatewayClientTransport`  | Ready   | WebSocket transport backed by the Gateway client.                            |
| `oc.agents`               | Ready   | Lists, creates, updates, deletes, and gets agent handles.                    |
| `Agent.run()`             | Ready   | Starts a Gateway `agent` run and returns a `Run`.                            |
| `oc.runs`                 | Ready   | Creates, gets, waits for, cancels, and streams runs.                         |
| `Run.events()`            | Ready   | Streams normalized per-run events with replay for fast runs.                 |
| `Run.wait()`              | Ready   | Calls `agent.wait` and returns a stable `RunResult`.                         |
| `Run.cancel()`            | Ready   | Calls `sessions.abort` by run id, with session key when available.           |
| `oc.sessions`             | Ready   | Creates, resolves, sends to, patches, compacts, and gets session handles.    |
| `Session.send()`          | Ready   | Calls `sessions.send` and returns a `Run`.                                   |
| `oc.models`               | Ready   | Calls `models.list` and the current `models.authStatus` status RPC.          |
| `oc.tools`                | Partial | Lists tool catalog and effective tools; direct tool invocation is not wired. |
| `oc.approvals`            | Ready   | Lists and resolves exec approvals through Gateway approval RPCs.             |
| `oc.rawEvents()`          | Ready   | Exposes raw Gateway events for advanced consumers.                           |
| `normalizeGatewayEvent()` | Ready   | Converts raw Gateway events into the stable SDK event shape.                 |

The SDK also exports the core types used by those surfaces:
`AgentRunParams`, `RunResult`, `RunStatus`, `OpenClawEvent`,
`OpenClawEventType`, `GatewayEvent`, `OpenClawTransport`,
`GatewayRequestOptions`, `SessionCreateParams`, `SessionSendParams`,
`RuntimeSelection`, `EnvironmentSelection`, `WorkspaceSelection`,
`ApprovalMode`, and related result types.

## Connect To A Gateway

Create a client with an explicit Gateway URL, or inject a custom transport for
tests and embedded app runtimes.

```typescript
import { OpenClaw } from "@openclaw/sdk";

const oc = new OpenClaw({
  url: "ws://127.0.0.1:14565",
  token: process.env.OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN,
  requestTimeoutMs: 30_000,
});

await oc.connect();
```

`new OpenClaw({ gateway: "ws://..." })` is equivalent to `url`. The
`gateway: "auto"` option is accepted by the constructor, but automatic Gateway
discovery is not a separate SDK feature yet; pass `url` when the app does not
already know how to discover the Gateway.

For tests, pass an object that implements `OpenClawTransport`:

```typescript
const oc = new OpenClaw({
  transport: {
    async request(method, params) {
      return { method, params };
    },
    async *events() {},
  },
});
```

## Run An Agent

Use `oc.agents.get(id)` when the app wants an agent handle, then call
`agent.run()`.

```typescript
const agent = await oc.agents.get("main");

const run = await agent.run({
  input: "Review this pull request and suggest the smallest safe fix.",
  model: "openai/gpt-5.5",
  sessionKey: "main",
  timeoutMs: 30_000,
});

for await (const event of run.events()) {
  const data = event.data as { delta?: unknown };
  if (event.type === "assistant.delta" && typeof data.delta === "string") {
    process.stdout.write(data.delta);
  }
}

const result = await run.wait({ timeoutMs: 120_000 });
console.log(result.status);
```

Provider-qualified model refs such as `openai/gpt-5.5` are split into Gateway
`provider` and `model` overrides. `timeoutMs` stays milliseconds in the SDK and
is converted to Gateway timeout seconds for the `agent` RPC.

`run.wait()` uses the Gateway `agent.wait` RPC. A wait deadline that expires
while the run is still active returns `status: "accepted"` instead of pretending
the run itself timed out. Runtime timeouts, aborted runs, and cancelled runs are
normalized into `timed_out` or `cancelled`.

## Create And Reuse Sessions

Use sessions when the app wants durable transcript state.

```typescript
const session = await oc.sessions.create({
  agentId: "main",
  label: "release-review",
});

const run = await session.send("Prepare release notes from the current diff.");
await run.wait();
```

`Session.send()` calls `sessions.send` and returns a `Run`. Session handles also
support:

```typescript
await session.abort(run.id);
await session.patch({ label: "renamed-session" });
await session.compact({ maxLines: 200 });
```

## Stream Events

The SDK normalizes raw Gateway events into a stable `OpenClawEvent` envelope:

```typescript
type OpenClawEvent = {
  version: 1;
  id: string;
  ts: number;
  type: OpenClawEventType;
  runId?: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  sessionKey?: string;
  taskId?: string;
  agentId?: string;
  data: unknown;
  raw?: GatewayEvent;
};
```

Common event types include:

| Event type            | Source Gateway event                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `run.started`         | `agent` lifecycle start                     |
| `run.completed`       | `agent` lifecycle end                       |
| `run.failed`          | `agent` lifecycle error                     |
| `run.cancelled`       | Aborted/cancelled lifecycle end             |
| `run.timed_out`       | Timeout lifecycle end                       |
| `assistant.delta`     | Assistant streaming delta                   |
| `assistant.message`   | Assistant message                           |
| `thinking.delta`      | Thinking or plan stream                     |
| `tool.call.started`   | Tool/item/command start                     |
| `tool.call.delta`     | Tool/item/command update                    |
| `tool.call.completed` | Tool/item/command completion                |
| `tool.call.failed`    | Tool/item/command failure or blocked status |
| `approval.requested`  | Exec or plugin approval request             |
| `approval.resolved`   | Exec or plugin approval resolution          |
| `session.created`     | `sessions.changed` create                   |
| `session.updated`     | `sessions.changed` update                   |
| `session.compacted`   | `sessions.changed` compaction               |
| `task.updated`        | Task update events                          |
| `artifact.updated`    | Patch stream events                         |
| `raw`                 | Any event without a stable SDK mapping yet  |

`Run.events()` filters events to one run id and replays already-seen events for
fast runs. That means the documented flow is safe:

```typescript
const run = await agent.run("Summarize the latest session.");

for await (const event of run.events()) {
  if (event.type === "run.completed") {
    break;
  }
}
```

For app-wide streams, use `oc.events()`. For raw Gateway frames, use
`oc.rawEvents()`.

## Models, Tools, And Approvals

Model helpers map to current Gateway methods:

```ty
