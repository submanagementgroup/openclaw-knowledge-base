Miscellaneous OpenClaw concepts: usage tracking, timezone handling, and experimental features.

## Usage Tracking

## What it is

- Pulls provider usage/quota directly from their usage endpoints.
- No estimated costs; only the provider-reported windows.
- Human-readable status output is normalized to `X% left`, even when an
  upstream API reports consumed quota, remaining quota, or only raw counts.
- Session-level `/status` and `session_status` can fall back to the latest
  transcript usage entry when the live session snapshot is sparse. That
  fallback fills missing token/cache counters, can recover the active runtime
  model label, and prefers the larger prompt-oriented total when session
  metadata is missing or smaller. Existing nonzero live values still win.

## Where it shows up

- `/status` in chats: emoji‑rich status card with session tokens + estimated cost (API key only). Provider usage shows for the **current model provider** when available as a normalized `X% left` window.
- `/usage off|tokens|full` in chats: per-response usage footer (OAuth shows tokens only).
- `/usage cost` in chats: local cost summary aggregated from OpenClaw session logs.
- CLI: `openclaw status --usage` prints a full per-provider breakdown.
- CLI: `openclaw channels list` prints the same usage snapshot alongside provider config (use `--no-usage` to skip).
- macOS menu bar: “Usage” section under Context (only if available).

## Providers + credentials

- **Anthropic (Claude)**: OAuth tokens in auth profiles.
- **GitHub Copilot**: OAuth tokens in auth profiles.
- **Gemini CLI**: OAuth tokens in auth profiles.
  - JSON usage falls back to `stats`; `stats.cached` is normalized into
    `cacheRead`.
- **OpenAI Codex**: OAuth tokens in auth profiles (accountId used when present).
- **MiniMax**: API key or MiniMax OAuth auth profile. OpenClaw treats
  `minimax`, `minimax-cn`, and `minimax-portal` as the same MiniMax quota
  surface, prefers stored MiniMax OAuth when present, and otherwise falls back
  to `MINIMAX_CODE_PLAN_KEY`, `MINIMAX_CODING_API_KEY`, or `MINIMAX_API_KEY`.
  MiniMax's raw `usage_percent` / `usagePercent` fields mean **remaining**
  quota, so OpenClaw inverts them before display; count-based fields win when
  present.
  - Coding-plan window labels come from provider hours/minutes fields when
    present, then fall back to the `start_time` / `end_time` span.
  - If the coding-plan endpoint returns `model_remains`, OpenClaw prefers the
    chat-model entry, derives the window label from timestamps when explicit
    `window_hours` / `window_minutes` fields are absent, and includes the model
    name in the plan label.
- **Xiaomi MiMo**: API key via env/config/auth store (`XIAOMI_API_KEY`).
- **z.ai**: API key via env/config/auth store.

Usage is hidden when no usable provider usage auth can be resolved. Providers
can supply plugin-specific usage auth logic; otherwise OpenClaw falls back to
matching OAuth/API-key credentials from auth profiles, environment variables,
or config.

## Timezone Handling

OpenClaw standardizes timestamps so the model sees a **single reference time**.

## Message envelopes (local by default)

Inbound messages are wrapped in an envelope like:

```
[Provider ... 2026-01-05 16:26 PST] message text
```

The timestamp in the envelope is **host-local by default**, with minutes precision.

You can override this with:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      envelopeTimezone: "local", // "utc" | "local" | "user" | IANA timezone
      envelopeTimestamp: "on", // "on" | "off"
      envelopeElapsed: "on", // "on" | "off"
    },
  },
}
```

- `envelopeTimezone: "utc"` uses UTC.
- `envelopeTimezone: "user"` uses `agents.defaults.userTimezone` (falls back to host timezone).
- Use an explicit IANA timezone (e.g., `"Europe/Vienna"`) for a fixed offset.
- `envelopeTimestamp: "off"` removes absolute timestamps from envelope headers.
- `envelopeElapsed: "off"` removes elapsed time suffixes (the `+2m` style).

### Examples

**Local (default):**

```
[Signal Alice +1555 2026-01-18 00:19 PST] hello
```

**Fixed timezone:**

```
[Signal Alice +1555 2026-01-18 06:19 GMT+1] hello
```

**Elapsed time:**

```
[Signal Alice +1555 +2m 2026-01-18T05:19Z] follow-up
```

## Tool payloads (raw provider data + normalized fields)

Tool calls (`channels.discord.readMessages`, `channels.slack.readMessages`, etc.) return **raw provider timestamps**.
We also attach normalized fields for consistency:

- `timestampMs` (UTC epoch milliseconds)
- `timestampUtc` (ISO 8601 UTC string)

Raw provider fields are preserved.

## User timezone for the system prompt

Set `agents.defaults.userTimezone` to tell the model the user's local time zone. If it is
unset, OpenClaw resolves the **host timezone at runtime** (no config write).

```json5
{
  agents: { defaults: { userTimezone: "America/Chicago" } },
}
```

The system prompt includes:

- `Current Date & Time` section with local time and timezone
- `Time format: 12-hour` or `24-hour`

You can control the prompt format with `agents.defaults.timeFormat` (`auto` | `12` | `24`).

See [Date & Time](/date-time) for the full behavior and examples.

## Experimental Features

Experimental features in OpenClaw are **opt-in preview surfaces**. They are
behind explicit flags because they still need real-world mileage before they
deserve a stable default or a long-lived public contract.

Treat them differently from normal config:

- Keep them **off by default** unless the related doc tells you to try one.
- Expect **shape and behavior to change** faster than stable config.
- Prefer the stable path first when one already exists.
- If you are rolling OpenClaw out broadly, test experimental flags in a smaller
  environment before baking them into a shared baseline.

## Currently documented flags

| Surface                  | Key                                                       | Use it when                                                                                                    | More                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local model runtime      | `agents.defaults.experimental.localModelLean`             | A smaller or stricter local backend chokes on OpenClaw's full default tool surface                             | [Local Models](/gateway/local-models)                                                         |
| Memory search            | `agents.defaults.memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory` | You want `memory_search` to index prior session transcripts and accept the extra storage/indexing cost         | [Memory configuration reference](/reference/memory-config#session-memory-search-experimental) |
| Structured planning tool | `tools.experimental.planTool`                             | You want the structured `update_plan` tool exposed for multi-step work tracking in compatible runtimes and UIs | [Gateway configuration reference](/gateway/config-tools#toolsexperimental)                    |

## Local model lean mode

`agents.defaults.experimental.localModelLean: true` is a pressure-release valve
for weaker local-model setups. It trims heavyweight default tools like
`browser`, `cron`, and `message` so the prompt shape is smaller and less brittle
for small-context or stricter OpenAI-compatible backends.

That is intentionally **not** the normal path. If your backend handles the full
runtime cleanly, leave this off.

## Experimental does not mean hidden

If a feature is experimental, OpenClaw should say so plainly in docs and in the
config path itself. What it should **not** do is smuggle preview behavior into a
stable-looking default knob and pretend that is normal. That's how config
surfaces get messy.
