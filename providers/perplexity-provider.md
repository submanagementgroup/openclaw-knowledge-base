The Perplexity plugin provides web search capabilities through the Perplexity
Search API or Perplexity Sonar via OpenRouter.

> **Note:** This page is the Perplexity **provider** setup. For the Perplexity **tool** (how the agent uses it), see [Perplexity tool](/tools/perplexity-search).


| Property    | Value                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type        | Web search provider (not a model provider)                             |
| Auth        | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` (direct) or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (via OpenRouter) |
| Config path | `plugins.entries.perplexity.config.webSearch.apiKey`                   |

## Getting started

**Set the API key**

Run the interactive web-search configuration flow:

    ```bash
    openclaw configure --section web
    ```

    Or set the key directly:

    ```bash
    openclaw config set plugins.entries.perplexity.config.webSearch.apiKey "pplx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

  
**Start searching**

The agent will automatically use Perplexity for web searches once the key is
    configured. No additional steps are required.
  
## Search modes

The plugin auto-selects the transport based on API key prefix:

**Native Perplexity API (pplx-):**

When your key starts with `pplx-`, OpenClaw uses the native Perplexity Search
    API. This transport returns structured results and supports domain, language,
    and date filters (see filtering options below).
  
**OpenRouter / Sonar (sk-or-):**

When your key starts with `sk-or-`, OpenClaw routes through OpenRouter using
    the Perplexity Sonar model. This transport returns AI-synthesized answers with
    citations.
  
| Key prefix | Transport                    | Features                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `pplx-`    | Native Perplexity Search API | Structured results, domain/language/date filters |
| `sk-or-`   | OpenRouter (Sonar)           | AI-synthesized answers with citations            |

## Native API filtering

> **Note:** Filtering options are only available when using the native Perplexity API
(`pplx-` key). OpenRouter/Sonar searches do not support these parameters.


When using the native Perplexity API, searches support the following filters:

| Filter         | Description                            | Example                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Country        | 2-letter country code                  | `us`, `de`, `jp`                    |
| Language       | ISO 639-1 language code                | `en`, `fr`, `zh`                    |
| Date range     | Recency window                         | `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`      |
| Domain filters | Allowlist or denylist (max 20 domains) | `example.com`                       |
| Content budget | Token limits per response / per page   | `max_tokens`, `max_tokens_per_page` |

## Advanced configuration

### Environment variable for daemon processes

If the OpenClaw Gateway runs as a daemon (launchd/systemd), make sure
    `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is available to that process.

    > **Note:** A key set only in `~/.profile` will not be visible to a launchd/systemd
    daemon unless that environment is explicitly imported. Set the key in
    `~/.openclaw/.env` or via `env.shellEnv` to ensure the gateway process can
    read it.
    

  ### OpenRouter proxy setup

If you prefer to route Perplexity searches through OpenRouter, set an
    `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (prefix `sk-or-`) instead of a native Perplexity key.
    OpenClaw will detect the prefix and switch to the Sonar transport
    automatically.

    > **Note:** The OpenRouter transport is useful if you already have an OpenRouter account
    and want consolidated billing across multiple providers.
