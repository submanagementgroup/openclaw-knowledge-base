The Volcengine provider gives access to Doubao models and third-party models
hosted on Volcano Engine, with separate endpoints for general and coding
workloads. The same bundled plugin can also register Volcengine Speech as a TTS
provider.

| Detail     | Value                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Providers  | `volcengine` (general + TTS) + `volcengine-plan` (coding)  |
| Model auth | `VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_KEY`                                   |
| TTS auth   | `VOLCENGINE_TTS_API_KEY` or `BYTEPLUS_SEED_SPEECH_API_KEY` |
| API        | OpenAI-compatible models, BytePlus Seed Speech TTS         |

## Getting started

**Set the API key**

Run interactive onboarding:

    ```bash
    openclaw onboard --auth-choice volcengine-api-key
    ```

    This registers both the general (`volcengine`) and coding (`volcengine-plan`) providers from a single API key.

  
**Set a default model**

```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          model: { primary: "volcengine-plan/ark-code-latest" },
        },
      },
    }
    ```
  
**Verify the model is available**

```bash
    openclaw models list --provider volcengine
    openclaw models list --provider volcengine-plan
    ```
  
> **Note:** For non-interactive setup (CI, scripting), pass the key directly:

```bash
openclaw onboard --non-interactive \
  --mode local \
  --auth-choice volcengine-api-key \
  --volcengine-api-key "$VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_KEY"
```



## Providers and endpoints

| Provider          | Endpoint                                  | Use case       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `volcengine`      | `ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3`        | General models |
| `volcengine-plan` | `ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/coding/v3` | Coding models  |

> **Note:** Both providers are configured from a single API key. Setup registers both automatically.

## Text-to-speech

Volcengine TTS uses the BytePlus Seed Speech HTTP API and is configured
separately from the OpenAI-compatible Doubao model API key. In the BytePlus
console, open Seed Speech > Settings > API Keys and copy the API key, then set:

```bash
export VOLCENGINE_TTS_API_KEY="byteplus_seed_speech_api_key"
export VOLCENGINE_TTS_RESOURCE_ID="seed-tts-1.0"
```

Then enable it in `openclaw.json`:

```json5
{
  messages: {
    tts: {
      auto: "always",
      provider: "volcengine",
      providers: {
        volcengine: {
          apiKey: "byteplus_seed_speech_api_key",
          voice: "en_female_anna_mars_bigtts",
          speedRatio: 1.0,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For voice-note targets, OpenClaw asks Volcengine for provider-native
`ogg_opus`. For normal audio attachments, it asks for `mp3`. Provider aliases
`bytedance` and `doubao` also resolve to the same speech provider.

The default resource id is `seed-tts-1.0` because that is what BytePlus grants
to newly created Seed Speech API keys in the default project. If your project
has TTS 2.0 entitlement, set `VOLCENGINE_TTS_RESOURCE_ID=seed-tts-2.0`.

> **Note:** `VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_KEY` is for the ModelArk/Doubao model endpoints and is not a
Seed Speech API key. TTS needs a Seed Speech API key from the BytePlus Speech
Console, or a legacy Speech Console AppID/token pair.


Legacy AppID/token auth remains supported for older Speech Console applications:

```bash
export VOLCENGINE_TTS_APPID="speech_app_id"
export VOLCENGINE_TTS_TOKEN="speech_access_token"
export VOLCENGINE_TTS_CLUSTER="volcano_tts"
```

## Advanced configuration

### Default model after onboarding

`openclaw onboard --auth-choice volcengine-api-key` currently sets
    `volcengine-plan/ark-code-latest` as the default model while also registering
    the general `volcengine` catalog.
  ### Model picker fallback behavior

During onboarding/configure model selection, the Volcengine auth choice prefers
    both `volcengine/*` and `volcengine-plan/*` rows. If those models are not
    loaded yet, OpenClaw falls back to the unfiltered catalog instead of showing an
    empty provider-scoped picker.
  ### Environment variables for daemon processes

If the Gateway runs as a daemon (launchd/systemd), make sure model and TTS
    env vars such as `VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_KEY`, `VOLCENGINE_TTS_API_KEY`,
    `BYTEPLUS_SEED_SPEECH_API_KEY`, `VOLCENGINE_TTS_APPID`, and
    `VOLCENGINE_TTS_TOKEN` are available to that process (for example, in
    `~/.openclaw/.env` or via `env.shellEnv`).
  > **Note:** When running OpenClaw as a background service, environment variables set in your
interactive shell are not automatically inherited. See the daemon note above.
